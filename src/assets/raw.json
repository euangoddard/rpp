When it is cool enough, put it in the fridge, before upspringing it from the tin. You can do this the day before, but it only needs a couple of hours in the fridge.\r\nMake the butterscotch sauce simply by putting the butter, sugars and syrup in a pan, bring to the boil and let it bubble for a few minutes, then add the cream and schnapps.

Turn down the heat to a highish simmer. Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take about 15 minutes. Taste the rice \u2013 is it cooked? Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite to it. Check seasoning.\r\nRemove from the heat and add the butter, the Parmesan and the warm, cooked borlotti beans. You may wish to save a little Parmesan to go on the top.

Spoon over the chicken and leave to cool.\r\nMeanwhile, preheat the oven to 220C/Gas 7/fan 200C. Reserve a quarter of the pastry for decoration and roll out the remainder to a shape about 5cm/2in larger than the top of the pie dish, then cut a 2.5cm/1in strip from all round the edge. Brush the edge of the dish with water and stick the pastry strip to it. Brush the strip with water. Flip the pastry lid over the rolling pin, lift it up and unroll over the pie. Press the edge on to the pastry strip to seal, and trim any excess with a sharp knife.\r\nTap the blade of a small sharp knife all along the outside edge of the pastry (this helps the edge to rise during cooking), then flute it using the back of the knife. Make a hole in the lid centre with the tip of the knife, to allow steam to escape as the pie bakes.\r\nRoll out the pastry you put aside earlier. Cut 8 long strips each about 1cm/1\u20442in wide, and two more strips each about 4cm/11\u20442in wide. Cut the wider strips diagonally to make eight diamond leaf shapes. Mark the veins of the leaves with the tip of a sharp knife. Brush the pastry lid with beaten egg, then lay the 8 thin strips on top, as in the picture. Brush again with egg and arrange the leaves in the centre, between the strips. Brush with egg.\r\nChill the pie for 15 mins, if you have time, to set the pastry. (Can be made a day ahead up to this point. Keep chilled and add 4-5 extra minutes at baking time.) Bake for 30 - 35 miutes until the pastry is crisp, puffed up and deep golden brown.)",

Alternatively, soak the ham overnight in cold water.\r\nRinse the saucepan, put the gammon back in and add all the ingredients except the glaze ingredients. If the ham is not covered by the liquid, top it up with water.\r\nBring the pan to a boil and cook the gammon at a fast simmer for 3\u00bd - 4 hours. Cover the pan with a lid if the liquid is boiling away and the top of the ham is getting dry.\r\nOnce the ham is cooked, remove it from the juice, saving the juice for later, and sit it on a board. If you need to, you can now let it cool until it is ready to be glazed.\r\nGlazing the ham:\r\nPre-heat the oven to 220\u00baC.\r\nWhen the ham is bearable to touch, cut and peel the rind off leaving a thin layer of white fat. Score the timed fat into a diamond pattern with a sharp knife and stud the points of each diamond with a clove.\r\nHeat the glaze ingredients in a saucepan until the jelly or sauce melts into the honey and mustard to make a smooth glaze and becomes syrupy enough so that it will not run off the ham when applied. If you are using sauce, you will have to cook it for longer so that they berries burst. Note: cranberry jelly tends to have a higher gloss.\r\nSit the ham on a piece of foil in a roasting tin; pour the glaze over the clove-studded ham so that all the fat is covered. Put into the oven and cook for 15 minutes until the fat is coloured and burnished by the sugary glaze. If you have let the ham completely cool, the ham will need a lot longer \u2013 about 40 minutes at 180\u00baC.\r\nServe immediately.\r\nIf you wish to make a sauce for the ham, reduce the excess liquid from the boiling stage with a little flour to thicken.\r\nCooking cabbage in the left-over liquid also makes a tasty accompaniment.",

Line 2 baking sheets with Bake-O-Glide non-stick liner or parchment paper (meringue can stick on greaseproof paper and foil).\r\nTip the egg whites into a large clean mixing bowl (not plastic). Beat them on medium speed with an electric hand whisk until the mixture resembles a fluffy cloud and stands up in stiff peaks when the blades are lifted.\r\nNow turn the speed up and start to add the caster sugar, a dessertspoonful at a time. Continue beating for 3-4 seconds between each addition. It's important to add the sugar slowly at this stage as it helps prevent the meringue from weeping later. However, don't over-beat. When ready, the mixture should be thick and glossy.\r\nSift a third of the icing sugar over the mixture, then gently fold it in with a big metal spoon or rubber spatula. Continue to sift and fold in the icing sugar a third at a time. Again, don't over-mix. The mixture should now look smooth and billowy, almost like a snow drift.\r\nScoop up a heaped dessertspoonful of the mixture. Using another dessertspoon, ease it on to the baking sheet to make an oval shape (pic 3). Or just drop them in rough rounds, if you prefer. Bake for 1 1\u20442 hours in a fan oven, 1 1\u20444 hours in a conventional or gas oven, until the meringues sound crisp when tapped underneath and are a pale coffee colour. Leave to cool on the trays or a cooling rack. (The meringues will now keep in an airtight tin for up to 2 weeks, or frozen for a month.) Serve two meringues sandwiched together with a generous dollop of softly whipped double cream.",

Cook for about 1 min, toss them, then add the garlic and a pinch of salt. Cook for another couple of minutes and then taste \u2013 if they are nicely cooked add some parsley, a very small pinch of chilli powder and a squeeze of lemon juice. Toss again, taste again \u2013 by now they should be pretty much perfect. Put aside.\r\nAt the same time, heat the stock. Then in a separate pan heat the olive oil, add the shallot or onion, celery and a pinch of salt, and sweat the vegetables for about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and after another 2 minutes, when the vegetables have softened, add the rice. Now add the cooked Pancetta and rosemary. Now turn up the heat.\r\nWhile stirring slowly, continuously, you are beginning to fry the rice. You don\u2019t want any colour at this point (so if the temperature seems too high, turn it down). You must keep the rice moving. After 2 or 3 minutes, it will begin to look translucent. Add the vermouth or wine, keeping on stirring as it hits the pan.\r\nOnce the vermouth or wine seems to have cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of stock and a pinch of salt. Add the mushrooms from stage 1. Turn down the heat to a highish simmer. Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take about 15 minutes. Taste the rice \u2013 is it cooked? Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite to it. Check seasoning.\r\nRemove from the heat and add the butter, the Parmesan. You may wish to save a little Parmesan to go on the top. Stir gently and eat as soon as possible whilst it retains its moist texture.\r\nServe it on its own or with a crisp green salad and a hunk of crusty bread.\r\n",

Heat chicken through in the sauce for 2-3 mins then turn off the heat and leave for a few mins before serving. This is such an aromatic and beautiful looking dish you should serve it straight from the casserole with the lid on.",

Add the vermouth or wine, keeping on stirring as it hits the pan.\r\nOnce the vermouth or wine seems to have cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of stock and a pinch of salt. Turn down the heat to a highish simmer. Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take about 15 minutes. Taste the rice \u2013 is it cooked? Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite to it. Check seasoning. Add the mashed peas and prawns and simmer for 2 minutes.\r\nRemove from the heat and add the butter. Throw in the herbs and the lemon juice.

Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take about 15 minutes. Taste the rice \u2013 is it cooked? Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite to it. Check seasoning.\r\nRemove from the heat and add the butter, the Parmesan and pecorino.

Stir in the mustard, if using.\r\nWhile the potatoes are cooking, heat a large, shallow flameproof dish or a large non-stick frying pan. Brown the sausages, shallots and carrots for about 5 mins until nicely golden and the shallots are starting to soften. The sausages should be almost cooked through; lift them out, then set aside. Tip off any excess fat released by the sausages.\r\nHeat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Turn up the heat under the pan, tip in the thyme and mushrooms, then fry until golden, about 3 mins. Splash in the wine, then let it bubble and reduce by half. Add the stock and caramelised onions, then simmer until it has reduced a little to make a shiny gravy, and the carrots are cooked through. Season, then add the sausages to the gravy.\r\nSpoon the mixture into a baking dish or keep in the pan if it's ovenproof. Top with the mashed potato, spooning it over in even dollops to prevent the gravy oozing up the sides. Can be made up to 1 day ahead and chilled. Bake, covered with foil, for 30 mins (or 45 mins from chilled), removing the foil for the final 10 mins to brown the mash. Sprinkle with a little thyme to serve.",

Spoon away any oil from the top, then stir in the mustard and Worcestershire sauce and finely grate in the cheese.

Wrap the dough in clingfilm and put into the fridge until needed.\r\nPreheat the oven to 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F/gas 4. Discard the shin bone and ladle the hot meaty stew into the pie dish (24 x 30cm, and about 4cm deep, is about right). Use some of the beaten egg to egg wash the edges of the pie dish, then dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour and roll out the pastry about 1cm thick and a little bit bigger than your pie dish. Carefully place on top of the pie, then trim off any overhanging pastry. Pinch and squash the edges of the pastry to the dish. Egg wash the top, and cook the pie right at the bottom of the hot oven for around 45 to 50minutes, or until your pastry is golden and gorgeous. Serve with steamed drained greens.",
