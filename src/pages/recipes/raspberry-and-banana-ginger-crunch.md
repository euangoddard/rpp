## Ingredients

- 5 bananas
- 350g frozen/fresh raspberries
- 250g gingernut biscuits
- 140g Demerara sugar
- 140g butter, melted

## Method

1. Heat oven to 180ºC/fan 160ºC/gas 4.
1. Thickly slice the bananas into a wide, shallow dish. Scatter the raspberries over the top.
1. Put the biscuits in a sturdy bowl and bash with the end of a rolling pin until reduced to crumbs. Alternatively, put into a food processor and whizz until fine crumbs. Stir in the sugar and the butter, making sure it is well mixed. Scatter evenly over the fruit.
1. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until just beginning to colour. Leave to stand for 10 minutes for the topping to crisp up.
1. Serve with custard or cream.
