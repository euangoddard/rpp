## Ingredients


### For the pastry

- 200 g cold unsalted butter, cubed
- 350 g plain flour, plus extra for rolling out
- ½ tsp ground ginger (optional)
- 100 g golden caster sugar
- 1 egg yolk

### For the filling

- 400 g golden syrup
- finely grated zest 1 lemon + juice of ½
- 100 g fine white breadcrumbs

## Method

1. Blitz the butter, flour and ginger, if using, in a food processor until the mix looks like fine crumbs. Stir in the sugar, then add the egg yolk and 2 tsp cold water. Pulse together until the dough clumps together, or bring it together with a knife by hand. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and press unto a smooth round. Chill for 30 mins or until firm.
1. Roll out the pastry to the thickness of 2 x £1 coins and stamp out 8 x 11cm circles (or cut around a saucer and trim to fit tins). Line tins with the pastry. Re-roll trimmings. With a small cutter, stamp out 8 designs to decorate. Chill tins and designs for 15 mins or until firm.
1. Heat oven to 170ºC/fan 150ºC.
1. Stir the syrup, lemon juice and zest together. Divide the breadcrumbs between tins. They should reach the top of the pastry. Spoon the syrup over slowly, adding more once the first lot has started to soak in. Top with the small pastry designs.
1. Put the tins into the oven and bake for 25 mins or until pastry is golden and the filling is orangey-gold and slightly set. Leave to cool for 15 mins and then turn on to a wire rack. Serve just warm.
1. Will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container. Heat in a low oven for 5 mins to warm through.
