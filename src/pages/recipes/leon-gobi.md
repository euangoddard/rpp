## Ingredients

- 1 medium onion, halved and thickly sliced
- 1 carrot, thickly sliced
- 2 tbsp sunflower oil
- 1 red chilli
- 2 thumb-sized pieces of root ginger
- 5 garlic cloves, peeled
- 1 large tsp Madras curry powder
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp black onion seeds
- 1 medium sweet potato, cut into 2.5cm dice
- 4 heaped tbsp ground almonds
- Handful of sultanas
- ½ small cauliflower, broken into florets
- 400ml tin coconut milk
- 150g frozen peas
- Juice of ½ a lemon
- Really big handful coriander, roughly chopped

## Method

1. In a large saucepan cook the onion and carrot over a medium-low heat in the oil for 15-20 mins with the lid on, stirring occasionally. Season with salt.
1. Blitz the chilli, ginger and garlic to a paste in a food processor. Stir the paste into the onions once they have begun to soften, along with the spices (including the onion seeds).
1. After another 5 mins, season with salt, add the sweet potato chunks and the almonds and mix well so that everything is well coated
1. Turn the heat up a bit and stir in 500ml water and the sultanas.
1. Bring it up to a simmer and leave it to bubble away gently for about 10-15 mins with the lid off, stirring occasionally.
1. Add the cauliflower florets and the coconut milk and simmer for a further 10-15 mins covered.
1. Check that the sweet potato and cauliflower are both cooked, then turn the heat off and stir in the peas.
1. It'll need more salt, plus the lemon juice and chopped coriander to finish it off right.
1. Serve with a sprinkling of dried coconut on top.
