## Ingredients

- drizzle of vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 24 rashers smoked streaky bacon
- 2 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs
- 400g pack sausages (pork & leek or preferred), meat removed from skins
- 8 sage leaves, chopped, plus a few small leaves to serve
- 250g cranberry sauce (homemade or jar)
- 450g turkey breast steaks

## Method

1. Heat a little oil in a frying pan. Grease a 900g loaf tin with a little extra oil.
2. Cook the onion gently for 10-15 minutes until soft and lightly caramelised. Tip into a large bowl and allow to cool.
3. Line the loaf tin with a double strip of foil, leaving plenty of overhang to act as handles for lifting the parcel out later.
4. Stretch the bacon rashers out using the back of a knife and then spread out across the base and up the sides of the tin so it is fully covered with an overhang.
5. Sprinkle the fresh breadcrumbs evenly over the bacon.
6. Add the sausage meat and chopped sage to the cooled onion and mix together. Pack half the stuffing mix into the tin and spread about a third of the cranberry sauce on top.
7. Slice each turkey breast steak into strips. Arrange roughly half the turkey over the stuffing to form a compact layer, season, then spread a little more cranberry sauce.
8. Repeat with the remaining stuffing, cranberry sauce and turkey so the tin is filled to the top. Fold the overhanging bacon over the filling, then wrap the tin tightly in foil to form a parcel. The parcel can now be chilled for up to 2 days or frozen.
9. **To cook**: heat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/Gas 4. Put the parcel (in its tin) on a baking tray and roast for 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove and rest for 10 minutes, then lift the parcel from the tin using the foil handles and place seam-side down on a baking tray.
10. Return to the oven for 15-20 minutes more to crisp and brown the outside. Check the centre is piping hot or reaches 75°C with a probe thermometer.
11. Cover loosely with foil and rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing. Serve topped with reserved sage leaves.
