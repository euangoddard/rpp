## Method

1. Preheat oven to 160ºC
1. Grease two 20cm sandwich tins and lines bases with baking parchment.
1. Mix cocoa with boiling water to form a smooth paste.
1. Add the remaining ingredients and whisk until smooth. It should form a thickish batter, don’t over whisk.
1. Divide mixture between tins and bake for 25-30 mins until well risen and just shrinking from the sides.
1. Let the cakes cool in their tins for about 10 mins, then loosen the edges and turn out onto a wire rack. Leave until cold.

1. Spread half over one cake, scatter third of fruits over top. Gently place the other cake on top and repeat. Decorate with icing sugar.
