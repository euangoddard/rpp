## Ingredients

- 2.25-2.75 kg boneless, mild cure gammon
- 2 litres coke
- 1 onion, peeled and cut in half

### for the glaze:

- about 16 cloves
- 2 tsp mustard powder
- 2 tbsp demerara sugar
- heaped tbsp black treacle

## Method

1. Put the ham snugly into a large saucepan and fill with cold water. Put the pan on the heat and bring to the boil, then drain the ham, rinse under a tap and put back in the saucepan.
1. Put the gammon in a pan, add the onion, then pour over the coke. Bring to the boil, reduce to a simmer, put the lid on and cook for about 2.5 hours
1. When you are ready to glaze the ham, preheat the oven to 240ºC.
1. Remove the ham from the liquid and strip off the rind. Cut a diamond pattern into the fat layer underneath. Stud each diamond with a clove.
1. Carefully spread the treacle over the skin taking care not to dislodge the cloves. Gently pat the mustard and sugar on to the sticky fat.
1. Cook in a roasting tin for about 10 minutes or until the glaze is burnished and bubbling. (If cooking from cool, allow 30-40 minutes at 180ºC for this part).
