## Ingredients

- 110g butter, softened
- 130g icing sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp. almond extract
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 400g flour
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. salt
- at least 40 almonds, whole and blanched
- 1 tube red decorator gel

## Method

1. Beat together the butter, sugar, egg, almond and vanilla extract.
1. Beat in the flour, baking soda and salt.
1. Cover and refrigerate for 30 mins.
1. Make the fingers in batches if necessary.
1. Roll heaped teaspoons of dough into finger shapes (squeeze in the centre to make a knuckle). Press an almond firmly into one end to make a nail. Make slashes in the knuckles.
1. Place on baking sheets and bake at 1600C for 15-25 mins or until pale, golden brown.
1. Let cool.
1. Lift up the almond and squeeze red decorator gel onto the nail bed and press the almond back so gel oozes out from underneath (very little is needed).
