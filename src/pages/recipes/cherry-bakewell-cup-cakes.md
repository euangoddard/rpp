## Ingredients


### For the cup cakes

- 150g unsalted butter, very soft
- 150g caster sugar
- 100g self raising flour
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature, beaten
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 60g ground almonds
- 1 tbsp milk, at room temperature
- 4 tbsps raspberry jam

### For the icing

- 250g icing sugar
- about 3 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 12 glace cherries, rinsed and dried

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 190 degrees.
1. Beat the butter with an electric mixer until creamy. Add al the other ingredients, apart from the jam, and beat until light and creamy.
1. Spoon the mixture into the cup cake cases, diving it evenly. I found one good tsp meant the cake didn't rise too much and make it easier to ice.
1. Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden brown. Leave to cool completely.
1. Sift the icing sugar into a mixing bowl and work in enough of the lemon juice to make a thick, spoonable and runny icing.
1. Using an apply corer, remove the centre from each cup cake, cutting only 2/3rds of the way down.
1. Stir the jam until it is a little runny and spoon into the holes of the cupcakes until the jam just reached the top.
1. Spoon the icing over the top of each cup cake to flood the surface until the icing reaches the sides of the paper case. Add a cherry to the top and leave to set.
