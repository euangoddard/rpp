## Ingredients

- 2 free range corn fed chickens, each about 1.5kg
- 2 lemons
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp clear honey
- 1 head spring garlic
- 200g tub crème fraiche
- few chives, finely chopped

## Method

1. Heat oven to 190ºC/170º fan.
1. Wipe the chickens and season all over.
1. Finely grate the zest of the lemons into a bowl. Cut the lemons in half, taking a thin slice from each half and set aside. Squeeze the juice from each half into the bowl with the zest. Loosen the skin of the chicken, then slide the two lemons slices under the skin on each breast. Smooth back the skins, then put the chickens in a large roasting tin.
1. Add 1tbsp of olive oil and the honey to the zest and juice, then pour over the chickens and inside the cavity.
1. Put the garlic on a sheet of foil, drizzle with the remaining oil and loosely wrap. Put in the roasting tin with the chickens.
1. Roast the chickens for 1 hour, then remove the garlic and roast the birds for a further 30 minutes, until the juices runs clear.
1. When the garlic is cool enough to handle, squeeze the flesh from the cloves into a small bowl. Mash down with a fork, then season and stir in the crème fraiche. Stir in some chives and set aside. Serve with the chicken.
