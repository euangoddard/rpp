## Ingredients

### For the maple and ginger granola

- 350g giant oats
- 125g pecans, roughly chopped
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 100ml vegetable oil
- 175ml maple syrup, plus extra to drizzle
- 1tsp vanilla essence
- 100g sultanas

### For the rhubarb and apple compote

- 250g sugar
- 400g rhubarb, roughly chopped
- 3 Bramley apples, peeled and diced
- Zest and juice of 1 orange
- 1350ml Greek yoghurt

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180C and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
1. Stir together the oats, pecans and spices. In a different bowl mix together oil, maple syrup and vanilla. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry to combine. Spread out on the baking tray in a single layer and cook for 30 minutes, shaking once.
1. When the granola is still warm, stir through the sultanas. Allow to cool.
1. Meanwhile, make the compote. Put all the ingredients, apart from the yoghurt, into a large pan with 200ml of water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 15-20 minutes, until soft and the liquid has reduced. Set aside to cook completely.
1. Assemble the trifle. Spoon a layer of compote into a trifle dish, top with a layer of yogurt, then one of granola. Repeat until you fill the dish. Top with a dollop of yogurt and a drizzle of maple syrup. Serve immediately of very soon to keep the granola crunchy.
