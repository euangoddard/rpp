## Ingredients

- 225g self raising flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil and more for brushing

## Method

1. Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Sprinkle over the oil and add enough water to make a soft, but not sticky dough - about 140mls. Add a little more flour or water as needed. Cover and leave to rest for 30 mins.
1. Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Roll each one into a circle about the thickness of a 20p coin. Brush the bottom third of one of the roti with oil using a pastry brush, and fold the oiled third towards the middle. Repeat with the top third, fold inwards, then turn the roti a quarter turn clockwise and repeat this process with the top and bottom third. Repeat with the remaining five rotis. Leave to rest again.
1. Heat a little oil in a heavy-based pan. Roll one of the roti thinly into a round with a rolling pin, and fry on one side until it puffs up and is speckled brown on the underside. Turn it over and fry on the other side for a few minutes, until it too is puffed and speckled brown. Remove from the pan and put in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the next 5 roti and serve warm.
