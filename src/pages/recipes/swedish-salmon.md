## Ingredients

- 1 salmon, weighing approx. 2.25kg, cleaned and scaled
- small bunch dill + extra for sauce
- 2tbsp Maldon salt + 1tsp
- 2 tbsp caster sugar
- 1tsp peppercorns
- 4 spring onions, whole
- 3 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 2 tbsp light brown sugar
- 250mls soured cream

## Method

1. Lay the salmon in a flame proof roasting tin (or fish kettle), cutting its head and tail off if necessary, and stuff the cavity with the dill.
1. Add 2 tbsp of salt, caster sugar, peppercorns and spring onions to your tin and pour over sufficient cold water just to cover the salmon.
1. Place on the heat and bring to the boil, then turn down to a gentle simmer, cover with foil and let bubble timidly for 10 minutes.
1. Remove the tin from the hob and turn the salmon over. Donâ€™t worry about ripping the skin as you will be filleting it later.
1. Leave to get cold (this takes a while, so if you plan to eat if for supper, make it in the morning) covering loosely with baking parchment.
1. When the water is cold, the salmon will be perfectly cooked.
1. Remove the salmon from its cold poaching liquid to a large piece of greaseproof paper. Take off the skin and carefully cut fillets off the fish in whatever way is easiest for you.
1. Arrange on a serving platter and get on with the sauce.
1. Whisk together the mustard and brown sugar and then whisk in the soured cream and vinegar, the remaining salt to taste and some dill. Transfer to a jug to serve along with the salmon.
1. Goes well with sweet and sour cucumber salad and warm potato salad.
