## Ingredients

- 2 x 150g fillet steaks
- 200g basmati rice
- 2 cardamom pods, bruised
- 1-2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander to serve

### for the marinade

- 1 tsp English mustard
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp garlic or chilli oil

### for the sauce

- 60ml sake (or Marsala or sherry)
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- Â½ tsp fish sauce
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce

## Method

1. In a freezer bag, combine the marinade ingredients, and add the steaks. Leave to marinate for a few hours or leave in the fridge for up to two days.
1. Let the steaks come to room temperature before you start cooking and you can put the rice on at the same time. Cook the rice with the bruised cardamom pods.
1. Heat a ridged griddle and then give the steaks, out of their marinade, 2 minutes a side or so, and remove the steaks, double-wrapping them in foil parcels. Let them rest for 10 minutes on a wooden board.
1. Bring the sake to a boil in a tiny saucepan to let the alcohol taste evaporate. Take the pan off the head and add the other sauce ingredients. Unwrap the steaks, removing them to a wooden board for carving as you do so, and pour the red juices gathering in the foil parcels into the pan of sauce.
1. Arrange some freshly boiled rice on two plates and slice the fillet steaks into thin diagonal slices. Lay the carved steak on top of the rice and spoon over the sauce, letting it gloss the meat and drip here and there over the rice. Scatter coriander on top.
