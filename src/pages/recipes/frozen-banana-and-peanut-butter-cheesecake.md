## Ingredients

- 3 small bananas, 2 mashed, 1 sliced
- 50g butter, melted
- 10 digestive biscuits, crushed to crumbs
- 142mL double cream
- 140g icing sugar
- 400g soft cheese
- Â½ tsp vanilla extract
- 237g crunchy peanut butter

## Method

1. Mix the butter and biscuits together then press into a 22cm spring-form cake tin.
1. Whip the cream until it just holds its shape.
1. In a separate bowl, beat the sugar, soft cheese and vanilla together until completely combined.
1. In another bowl, beat the peanut butter to loosen it.
1. Fold the cheese mixture into the peanut butter, then tip in the masked banana and gently fold in the cream. Spread the mix over the biscuit base and smooth the top. Freeze for several hours or overnight.
1. To serve, leave the cake in the fridge for 20 mins, then run a knife around the side and remove the sides of the tin. Decorate the cheesecake with remaining banana.
