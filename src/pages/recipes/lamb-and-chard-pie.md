## Ingredients

- 200g pack pizza dough mix
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 garlic clove, sliced
- olive oil
- 100g lamb, minced or leftovers from a roast
- ½ tsp ground cumin
- ½ tsp cinnamon
- a large bunch chard, stalks chopped and leaves shredded (rainbow chard looks pretty)
- 100g feta cheese, crumbled
- pomegranate molasses to finish, optional

## Method

1. Heat the oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Make the dough following packet instructions and leave under a cloth while you make the topping.
1. Fry the onion and garlic in a little olive oil until just soft, add the lamb and spices and fry until browned. Add the chard and fry over a high heat until it wilts and almost crisps. Season.
1. Divide the dough into 2 and stretch and roll each piece into a teardrop shape. Top with the lamb mix and feta, trickle over some olive oil and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the edges are browned and the bases cooked. Drizzle with pomegranate molasses if using.
