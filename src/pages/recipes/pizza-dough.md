## Ingredients

- 325ml warm water
- 10g salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 250g strong white flour
- 250g plain flour
- 5g dried yeast
- course flour (e.g. semolina or polenta) to dust

## Method

1. Put all the ingredients in order in a bread maker, taking care to keep the yeast apart from the water with the flour.
1. Set the breadmaker going on its dough cycle.
1. When the cycle is complete, divide the dough into 8 equal-sized balls, using some of the course flour to stop it sticking and leave to prive for another 30 minutes under a tea towel.
1. Use more course flour to help you roll the dough into pizza bases. Each one should be roughly 8" in diameter.
