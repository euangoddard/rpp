## Ingredients

- 100g unsalted butter
- ½ white cabbage, cut into 3mm-wide strips (400g net)
- 250g chestnut mushrooms, finely sliced
- 200g baby leaf spinach
- 3 rosemary sprigs, leaves picked and finely chopped, to get 2 tbsp
- fine sea salt and black pepper
- 2 tsp rose harissa paste, plus ½ tsp oil from the jar, for serving
- 4 shop-bought plain or sweet pancakes
- 150g taleggio, or camembert or brie, cut into 4 slices

## Method

1. Put the first five ingredients in a large frying pan, add a teaspoon of salt, and cook on a high heat, stirring often, for about 20 minutes, until the vegetables have softened but not taken on any colour.
1. Add the harissa paste and a good grind of pepper, cook for another minute, then turn down the heat to medium-low.
1. Meanwhile, turn on the grill to its highest setting. Lay one pancake on top of the cabbage mixture and leave it there for 30 seconds, to soften.
1. Transfer the pancake to a 20cm x 30cm baking tray lined with greaseproof paper, spoon a quarter of the cabbage mixture over one half of the pancake and fold over the other half to cover the filling. Move the filled pancake to the edge of the tray, then repeat with the remaining three pancakes, softening them first on top of the cabbage mix before filling and nestling them together on the tray.
1. Top each pancake with a slice of taleggio, then grill for a minute or two, until the cheese melts and starts to brown.
1. Remove from the oven, drizzle the harissa oil all over the top of the pancakes, add a good grind of pepper and serve straight from the tray.
