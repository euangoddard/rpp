## Ingredients

- 1 large sweet potato
- 1 large red potato
- 1 red onion
- 1 yellow pepper
- 1 red pepper
- 1/2 head garlic
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- black pepper
- 125g halloumi cheese, sliced as thinly as possible

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200ÂºC
1. Cut the sweet potato into rough 4cm cubes and the red potato slightly smaller (2 1/2cm) as the sweet potato will cook more quickly. Halve the red onion, then cut each half into 4-6 segments. De-seed the peppers and cut into 2 1/2 cm squares, and separate the cloves of garlic.
1. Put everything into a large roasting tin and give the vegetables a good coating of olive oil. Season with black pepper and then turn everything through thoroughly.
1. Cook for 45 mins, by which time the vegetables should be cooked through and here and there tinged with brown.
1. Place the cheese over the vegetables and grill for 5-10 until the cheese has melted and turned slightly brown on top.
