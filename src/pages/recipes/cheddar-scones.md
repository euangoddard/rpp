## Ingredients

- 200g self-raising flour
- 50g butter, at room temperature
- 25g porridge oats
- 75g grated cheddar, plus a little extra for topping (optional)

## Method

1. Heat oven to 220oC/fan 200/gas 7.
1. Place the flour in a large bowl, then rub in the butter. Stir in the oats and cheese, then the milk. Bring together. If it is too dry, add a little more milk (but be careful â€“ it may seem dry, but working it might remove that).
1. Dust the surface with a little flour. Roll out the dough no thinner than 2cm. Using a 4cm plain cutter, firmly stamp out the rounds. Re-roll the trimmings and stamp out more.
1. Transfer to a non-stick baking sheet, dust with a little more flour or grated cheese, then bake for 12-15 minutes until well risen and golden. Cool on a wire rack before serving.
