## Ingredients

- 1 small pumpkin, about 2kg
- 1 butternut squash, about 2kg
- 4 tbsp butter
- 4 tbsp maple syrup or brown sugar
- 1 large carrot, roughly chopped
- 1 large onion, cut into eighths
- 1.2 litre chicken or vegetable stock
- 1 head garlic
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp salt
- ½ tsp pepper

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180ºC
1. Cut the pumpkin and squash into quarters. Scoop out the seeds and discard. Arrange the quarters skin-side down in a roasting tin (use two if necessary). Place ½ tbsp butter and ½ tbsp maple syrup into the cavity of each pumpkin and squash quarter. Arrange the carrot and onion around the pumpkin and squash. 
1. Pour 500ml of the stock around the vegetables and cover the tin tightly with foil. Wrap the garlic head in another piece of foil. Place the roasting tin and the wrapped garlic into the oven and roast for 2 hours.
1. Allow the vegetables to cool slightly. Scoop the flesh from the pumpkin and squash and place in a large saucepan. Discard the skin. Add the onion, carrot and any juice. Unwrap the garlic head and squeeze the roasted pulp from the skins into the pot.
1. Add the mustard, salt, pepper and remaining stock. Bring to the boil then simmer for 10 minutes. Puree the soup in batches and return to the pan. Reheat gently and serve.
