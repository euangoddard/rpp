## Ingredients

- 3 medium raw beetroot (unpeeled)
- 6 vine-ripened tomatoes, halved lengthways
- 8 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 small butternut squash (about 600g), peeled and chopped into 3cm dice
- 2 cloves or garlic, chopped
- 200g chestnut mushrooms
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- ½ a head of broccoli
- 3 tbsp quinoa
- 150g red cabbage, finely shredded
- 60g fresh or frozen peas
- 3 tbsp mixed toasted seeds
- 30g alfalfa sprouts
- salt and pepper

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200ºC
1. Put two of the beetroot into a small roasting tray with a good sprinkle of salt and about 100ml water. Cover with foil, and put them into the oven on the top shelf until a knife goes in without a lot of resistance - about 1½ hours.
1. Lay the tomatoes on a baking tray cut side up. Season and drizzle liberally with olive oil. Roast them in the oven for around 1 hour on the lowest shelf.
1. Put the cubes of butternut squash on another baking tray and roll them in a little oil and plenty of seasoning. Roast them in the oven on the middle shelf for 45 minutes, then stir, moving everything around at least once during the cooking time.
1. When all the veg are done, leave them to cool, but peel the beetroot while they are still warm and cut them into wedges.
1. Put another couple of tablespoons oil into a hot frying pan and sauté the garlic for a moment, swiftly followed by the mushrooms. Season with salt, pepper and lemon juice and get them out of the pan in less than 4 minutes.
1. Put a small pan of water on to boil with a little salt in it. Cut the broccoli florets off the trunk, blanch them in the boiling water for a couple of minutes with the peas, then drain and run them under cold water until completely cooked.
1. Stir the quinoa into the broccoli water and simmer for 15 minutes, then drain.
1. Grate the last (raw) beetroot and mix with the shredded cabbage.
1. Meanwhile, start building this labour of love, starting with the cabbage/beetroot mix on the bottom, then the broccoli, peas, tomatoes, mushrooms, toasted seeds and finishing with the alfalfa sprouts.
1. All that remains is to season and dress sharply.
