## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp Maldon salt
- 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
- 2 tbsp peppercorns
- 60mls olive oil
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 kg small chicken wings

## Method

1. Crush the salt and garlic in a pestle and mortar until it resembles a paste. Add the peppercorns and continue bashing until the pepper is slightly crushed. Then add oil and lemon juice and pour the marinade over the chicken wings. It is best if you leave this to marinade over night.
1. Preheat the oven to 220 degrees. Let the marinaded chicken come to room temperature. Line a shallow roasting dish with foil, then pour in the wings and their marinade, making sure everything is spread out. Roast for about 40 minutes, turning them half way through until they are cooked through and crisp.
