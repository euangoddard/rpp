## Ingredients

- 450g baby new potatoes, halved
- 4 eggs
- 75g chopped caramelized or flame-roasted peppers from a jar
- 3 spring onions, finely sliced
- 75 grated Manchego or Cheddar cheese
- 1 tsp butter
- drop of oil
- salt and pepper to taste

## Method

1. Cook the potatoes in boiling water for 15 mins, until cooked through, then drain.
1. Heat up the grill.
1. Whisk the eggs in a bowl, add the peppers, spring onions and cheese, and season with salt and pepper, then add the cooked drained potatoes.
1. Heat the butter and oil in a small, heavy-based frying pan, and, when hot, pour in the omelette mix and cook gently for 5 mins.
1. By this time, the bottom of the omelette should be set and, rather than turn it, simply sit the pan under the grill for a few minutes to set the top.
1. Turn the omelette upside-down onto a plate to let cool. Don't worry if it feels a little wobbly in the middle, as it will carry on cooking as it cools.
1. Once cool, slice into 4 large wedges.
