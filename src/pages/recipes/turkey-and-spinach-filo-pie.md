## Ingredients

- 1 onion, chopped
- good pinch ground cumin
- 450g pack frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry (or fresh, steamed)
- 200g cooked turkey breast, shredded (or poach it – put thin steaks into a pan with a handful chopped spring onions with just enough water to cover. Pop on a lid and poach for about 5 mins over a low heat)
- 100g feta, crumbled
- 100g full fat soft cheese
- 6 sheets of filo or 200g puff pastry

## Method

1. Heat oven to 200ºC.
1. Fry the onion gently until softened. Stir in the cumin and cook for 30 seconds.
1. Take the pan off the heat, then stir in the spinach, turkey, feta and soft cheese. Season.
1. Brush a baking dish with oil. Line with 3 sheets of filo, brushing each side with a little oil. Spread the turkey mix over, then cover with the remaining filo, brushing again with oil.
1. Tuck the overhanging filo edges in to seal the pie and brush once more with oil.
1. Bake for 20 mins until the filo is cooked through and golden. Serve warm or cold.
