## Ingredients

- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 small knob of fresh root ginger, chopped
- 1 heaped tabs curry powder
- 1 heaped tabs ground coriander
- 1 heaped tabs ground cinnamon
- 1-2 tabs olive oil
- 1 knob butter
- 3 medium carrots, chopped
- 3 sticks celery, chopped
- 2 parsnips, chopped
- 1 litre vegetable stock
- 2 bananas, sliced
- fresh or tinned pineapple, chopped (and a little of its juice)

## Method

1. In a large saucepan, fry off the onion, ginger and spices in the oil and butter for about 2 minutes.
1. Add the celery, carrots and parsnips. Stir together and fry for a further 4-5 minutes.
1. Stir in the vegetable stock (just enough to cover the vegetables) then bring to the boil and simmer for 20-25 minutes.
1. When the vegetables are soft, allow to cool a little and then liquidize.
1. Add the sliced bananas and liquidize again. Reheat if necessary, adding chopped pineapple and more of the stock/pineapple juice until a nice consistency is achieved.
