## Ingredients


### Marinade ingredients

- 200ml natural yoghurt
- 1 heaped tsp dried chilli flakes or chilli powder
- 1 fat thumb-sized piece of root ginger, grated
- 1/2 heaped tsp turmeric
- 4 cardamon pods
- 3 bay leaves
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1kg diced lamb or mutton

### The rest

- 4 tbsp groundnut or sunflower oil
- 1 1/2 tsp mustard seeds
- 1 medium Spanish onion, chopped
- 100g ground almonds
- about 400-500mls chicken stock
- 500g umpkin or butternut squash, diced
- 150g frozen peas
- 1 green pepper
- 4 vine-ripened tomatoes, cut into wedges
- big handful coriander (optional)

## Method

1. Put all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and coat the meat well. Leave as long as possible, preferably overnight.
1. Fry the mustard seeds until they begin to pop. Add the onion and stir for a couple of minutes.
1. Tip in the marinaded meat and cook until the meat is brown on all sides.
1. Add the ground almonds and stir until the meat is well coated. Pour in just enough stock to cover the meat.
1. Simmer for 1 hour 30 mins with the lid on, giving it regular stirs as the almonds tends to stick, until the meat is tender.
1. Add the pumpkin/squash and pepper and push them under the surface of the liquid. Add more water if you need to. Keep the lid off and cook for another 20-30 mins until the pumpkin is beginning to lose it shape.
1. Take off the heat and stir in the tomatoes and peas. Put the lid back on and leave for 10 minutes for them to soften up.
1. Season and serve with rice, yoghurt and coriander.
