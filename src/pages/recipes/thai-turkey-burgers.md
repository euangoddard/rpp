## Method

1. Place the mince, breadcrumbs, curry paste, spring onions and egg into a large bowl. Season lightly, then mix well with your hands to combine. Divide into 4 and shape into burgers. Chill for 20 mins.
1. Meanwhile, make the Mango Pickle Mayo and the Spicy Mango Salsa by mixing together the respective ingredients in small bowls. Put aside.
