## Ingredients

- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 15 sage leaves
- 200g cooked and roughly chopped chestnuts (vacuum packed)
- 500g carrots, peeled and thinly sliced
- 800ml vegetable or chicken stock
- 150g puff pastry
- 75g Gruyere cheese, finely grated
- 3 tbsp creme fraiche

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to fan 180ÂºC.
1. In a large saucepan, soften the onion in 1 tbsp olive oil for 5 mins. Shred 3 of the sage leaves ad add to the pan. Then add the chestnuts, carrots and stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, partially cover and simmer for 25 mins, until the carrots are tender.
1. Meanwhile, roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to form a rectangle just more than 35x12cm. Trim the edges to neaten, then cut into 3 smaller rectangles and halve each diagonally to make 6 triangles. Scatter evenly with the Gruyere and press down firmly. Roll up from the wider 'base' of each triangle to make 6 'cigars'.
1. Bake on a lined baking sheet for 15 mins or until golden. Cool on wire racks.
1. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a small frying pan and add the remaining sage. Fry until crisp and fragrant, but not coloured. Tip onto kitchen towel to drain.
1. Blend the soup until smooth. Season to taste.
1. If wanted, serve with a spoonful of creme fraiche, the sage and some pepper along with the Gruyere sticks.
