## Ingredients

- 300g plain flour (all purpose flour) + extra for dusting & adjusting dough
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 50g butter
- 185 ml milk
- 1/2 tbsp oil (for cooking)

## Method

1. Melt the butter in the microwave. Add the flour, salt and milk and work with a paddle until combined to form a dough.
1. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour until it no longer sticks to your hands when you work it.
1. Knead by hand for a minute and then leave to rest for 30 mins.
1. When ready to cook, heat a little oil in a large frying pan on high, then use a knife to divide the dough into 4 equal parts.
1. Take a piece of the dough and roll flat on a floured work surface. Lift the dough, taking care to shake off any excess flour , and lay in the hot pan. Fry for one and half minutes and then flip over for another minute. The surface of the dough should be starting to colours with brown spots.
1. Repeat the process for the other pieces of dough.
