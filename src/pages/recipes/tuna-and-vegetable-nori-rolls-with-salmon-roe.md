## Ingredients

- 2 nori sheets
- 1/2 Lebanese cucumber
- 1/2 small carrot, peeled
- 1/2 shallot, trimmed
- 160g-piece fresh tuna
- 1 tbs pickled ginger, drained
- 1 tbs salmon roe or caviar (optional)
- Wasabi paste, to serve
- Sushi soy sauce, to serve

## Method

1. Use scissors to cut the nori sheets into sixteen 10 x 4cm rectangles. Cut the cucumber, carrot and shallot into 6cm-long matchsticks. Cut the tuna crossways into 5cm-long strips.
1. Place 1 nori rectangle, shiny-side down, on a clean work surface. Place a piece of tuna along 1 narrow edge so the ends are exposed. Top with some pickled ginger, cucumber, carrot and shallot.
1. Lightly brush the end of the nori with a little water. Roll up firmly, pressing lightly to seal. Transfer to a serving platter and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining nori, tuna, pickled ginger, cucumber, carrot and shallot, to make 16 rolls.
1. Top each roll with a small teaspoonful of salmon roe or caviar, if desired. Serve with the wasabi paste and soy sauce.
