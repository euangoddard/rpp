## Ingredients


### For the cake

- 175g unsalted butter
- 125g dark muscovado sugar
- 2 tbsp caster sugar
- 200g golden syrup
- 200g black treacle or molasses
- ¼ tsp ground cloves
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 2 tsp ground ginger
- 1 ¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 2 tbsp warm water
- 2 eggs
- 250ml milk
- 275g plain flour
- 40g cocoa
- 175g chocolate chips

### For the icing

- 250g icing sugar
- 30g unsalted butter
- 1 tbsp cocoa
- 60ml ginger ale
- You will need a roasting tin approximately 30 x 20 x 5 cm deep

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 170ºC. Line the roasting tin with baking parchment.
1. Melt the butter with the sugar, golden syrup, treacle/molasses, cloves, cinnamon and ground ginger.
1. In a cup dissolve the bicarbonate of soda in the water.
1. Take the saucepan off the heat and beat in the eggs, milk and bicarb in its water. Stir in the flour and cocoa and beat with the wooden spoon to mix.
1. Fold in the chocolate chips and pour into the lined tin and bake for about 45 minutes, until risen and firm. It will be slightly damp underneath the set top and that’s the way you want it.
1. Remove to a wire rack and let it cool in the tin.
1. Once cool, get on with the icing. Heat the butter, cocoa and ginger ale. Once the butter is melted, whisk in the icing sugar.
1. Lift out the chocolate gingerbread out of the tin and unwrap the paper. Pour over the icing sugar just to cover the top and cut into fat slabs when set.
