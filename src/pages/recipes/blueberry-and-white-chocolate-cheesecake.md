## Ingredients

- For the biscuit base
- 225g Hobnobs
- 100g butter, melted
- For the cheesecake
- 300g white chocolate
- 200g pack full fat soft cheese, at room temperature
- 25g caster sugar
- 500ml double cream
- For the blueberries
- 350g blueberries
- 100g icing sugar + extra 25g to sweeten if necessary

## Method

1. Process the biscuits in a food processor to fine crumbs. Then add in the melted butter, blitz again and spoon into the base of a spring-form tin. Chill in the fridge while you make the filling.
1. For the cheesecake, melt the chocolate in a bowl over gently simmering water. Cool until tepid.
1. Beat together the soft cheese and sugar together until smooth. Then stir in the melted chocolate.
1. Whip the cream into very soft peaks and then gently fold into the chocolate mix. Spoon into the tin and smooth the top. Refrigerate for 2-3 hours to set or overnight.
1. Meanwhile, place the blueberries, icing sugar and 4tbsp of water in a saucepan and warm gently until the sugar has dissolved and the berries are starting to burst and soften, but are still keeping their shape.
1. Spoon the berries from the pan into a bowl, leaving the syrup in the pan. If the syrup is too thin, simmer for a few more minutes. Pour the syrup over the blueberries and leave to cool and thicken slightly. This can be done a day ahead.
1. Remove the cheesecake from the tin and spoon the cold blueberries and their syrup over the top.
