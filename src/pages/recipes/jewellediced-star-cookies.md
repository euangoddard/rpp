## Ingredients


### Biscuits: 

- 300g plain flour
- pinch of salt
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. ground cinnamon
- ¼ tsp. ground cloves
- 1 tsp. ground pepper
- 100g unsalted butter
- 100g dark muscovado sugar
- 2 large eggs, beaten with 4tbsp runny honey

### Decoration:


### Jewelled:

- packet of coloured, boiled sweets

### Icing:

- 250g packet icing (made according to instructions)
- coloured balls (and ribbons)

## Method

1. Heat the oven to 170ºC (icing)/180ºC (jewelled)
1. Combine the flour, salt, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves and pepper in a processor. 
1. Mix in butter and sugar.
1. Slowly add egg/honey mixture until the mixture comes together (it may not need all the liquid).
1. Dust a surface with flour, roll out a disc of dough (also floured) to about 5mm and cut out stars.
1. If using the jewelled recipes, cut out a star inside each biscuit (best to do this on the baking tray). Place a crushed, boiled sweet in the centre of each.
1. Re-roll and cut out more stars.
1. If you want to hang these stars up, use a small icing nozzle to cut out a hole.
1. Arrange on the baking sheet and cook for 15 mins (icing)/10 mins (jewelled). If the underside is no longer doughy, they are ready.
1. Allow to cool. 
1. Decorate if needed with icing and ribbons.
