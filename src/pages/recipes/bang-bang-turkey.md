## Ingredients


### For the bang bang sauce:

- 2 tsp groundnut oil
- 3 tbsp smooth peanut butter
- 2 tbsp Chinese chilli bean sauce
- 1 tbsp caster sugar
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Â½ tbsp Chinese black vinegar (red wine vinegar will do)
- 2 tbsp water

### For the salad:

- 275g cold, shredded turkey
- 1 medium head iceberg lettuce, finely shredded
- 20g/small bunch fresh coriander, chopped
- 20g/small bunch fresh mint, chopped
- 125g cucumber

## Method

1. Make the sauce, heat the groundnut oil in a small saucepan, and let it cool. Pour into a bowl, add the remaining ingredients and whisk to make a smooth, thickly runny paste. This can be made up to a week in advance and kept in a jam jar or clingfilmed bowl.
1. Arrange the shredded lettuce over the base of a large, flat plate, then sprinkle the chopped coriander and mint over the top. Drip 4-5 tbsp of bang bang sauce over the lettuce and herbs, and in a smallish bowl, add 4 tbsp to the turkey strips turning them in the sauce until well coated.
1. Arrange the peanutty turkey strips in a rough line down the middle of the salad, and then peel and deseed he cucumber and cut into fine strips. Halve the spring onion and finely slice that in long strips, then sprinkle both over the turkey. Dribble over a tbsp or so more of sauce and serve.
