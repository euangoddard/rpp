## Ingredients

- 9 slices of thick sliced good quality, white bread (one day old)
- 150g of dark continental chocolate (minimum 70% cocoa solids)
- 425ml whipping cream
- 4 tabs dark rum
- 110g caster sugar
- 75g butter
- a good pinch of cinnamon
- 3 large eggs

## Method

1. Begin by removing the crust from the bread. Cut each slice into 4 triangles
1. Next place the chocolate, whipping cream, rum, sugar, butter and cinnamon in a bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Be careful not to let the bowl touch the water.
1. Wait until the butter and chocolate have melted and the sugar has completely dissolved
1. Next remove the bowl from the heat and give it a good stir.
1. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, pour the chocolate mixture over them and whisk thoroughly to blend them.
1. Then spoon about a centimetre layer of chocolate mixture into the base of a shallow, lightly buttered oven-proof dish, and arrange half of the bread triangles over the chocolate in overlapping rows.
1. Now pour half the remaining chocolate mixture over the bread and arrange the rest of the triangles over that.
1. Finish off with the remainder of the chocolate mixture. Use a fork to press the break gently down, so that it gets covered evenly with the liquid as it cools.
1. Cover the dish with cling-film and allow it to cool before transferring to the fridge for a minimum of 24 hours, but preferably 48 hours before cooking
1. When you are ready to cook the pudding, preheat the oven to 180ÂºC.
1. Remove the cling-film and bake in the oven for 30-35 minutes, by which time the top will be crunchy and the inside soft and squidgey.
1. Leave it to stand for 10 minutes before serving with double cream.
