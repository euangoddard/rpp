## Ingredients

- 4 pork chops
- 100-140g Stilton or other blue cheese, thinly sliced
- 4 rounded tbsp apple sauce

## Method

1. Turn on the grill. Season the chops on both sides with a good sprinkling of salt and pepper. Grill under a moderate heat for 12-16 minutes, turning once, until just cooked. 
1. Add the topping. Spoon the apple sauce over the chops and top each one with a couple of slices of cheese. Slide back under the grill for 2-3 minutes until the cheese is melted and tinged brown.
