- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 6 cloves of garlic
- 1 litre of chicken/vegetable stock

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200ÂºC
1. There is no need to peel the pumpkin, just chop into large pieces, scraping away any seeds and soft fibres.
1. Lay the slices in a large roasting tin and drizzle generously with olive oil. Scatter the garlic cloves, whole and with the skin on, over the tray and season well.
1. Roast for 35-40 minutes, turning once or twice if you like.
1. Use a spoon to scrape the soft flesh away from the skin and add this to the stock.
1. Liquidise and reheat before serving.
