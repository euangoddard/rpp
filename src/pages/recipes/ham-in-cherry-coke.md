## Ingredients

- 2.25-2.75 kg boneless, mild cure gammon
- 2 litres cherry coke
- 1 onion, halved

### For the glaze

- about 16 cloves
- 3-4 tbsp cherry jam
- 1 tsp smoked paprika

## Method

1. Put the ham snugly into a large saucepan and fill with cold water. Put the pan on the heat and bring to the boil, then drain the ham, rinse under a tap and put back in the saucepan.
1. Add the cherry coke and the onion halves. If the liquid doesn’t cover the ham, add some water. Turn up the heat and bring to the boil. Then turn down to a simmer. Cook for about 2-2¼ hours (about 1 h 10 min per kilo)
1. When you are ready to glaze the ham, preheat the oven to 230ºC.
1. Remove the ham from the liquid and strip off the rind. Cut a diamond pattern into the fat layer underneath. Stud each diamond with a clove.
1. Put the jam, paprika and red wine vinegar into a saucepan and whisk together over a high heat bringing it to the boil.
1. Let the pan bubble away so that the glaze reduces to a syrupy consistency.
1. Sit the ham in a roasting pan on a layer of foil and pour the glaze over. Put it in the oven for about 15 mins or until the glazed fat has caught and burnished.
1. For pleasant gravy, reserve some of the liquid form stage 4 and reduce with a little corn flour. The liquid from point 4 can also be used to add flavour to steamed cabbage.
