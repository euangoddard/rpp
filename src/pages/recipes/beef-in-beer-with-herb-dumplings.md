## Ingredients


### For the stew

- 2 large onions, thinly sliced
- 8 carrots, sliced
- 4 tbsp plain flour
- 1.25kg stewing steak, cut into cubes
- 425mls stout
- 2 tsp muscovado sugar
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme, chopped

### Herb dumplings

- 115g self raising flour
- 55g shredded suet
- 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
- about 4 tbsp water

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 160.
1. Heat some oil in a flameproof casserole. Add the onions and carrots and cover over a low heat, until the onions are softened.
1. Meanwhile place the flour in a polythene bag and season with salt and pepper. Add the stewing steak to the bag and shake well to coat.
1. Remove the vegetables from the casserole. Add the stewing steak and brown all over. Return the vegetables to the casserole and add any remaining seasoned flour. Pour in the stout and add the sugar, bay and thyme. Bring to the boil, cover and transfer to the preheated over for 1 3/4 hours.
1. For the dumplings, sift the flour and some salt into a bowl. Stir in the suet and parsley and enough water to make a soft dough. Shape into small balls.
1. Add to the casserole and return to the oven for 30 mins. Serve immediately.
