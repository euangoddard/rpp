## Ingredients

- 2 x 8oz sirloin steaks
- 1 x 8oz pack closed-cup mushrooms, cleaned and stalks trimmed.
- 2oz butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- zest 1 orange
- 1 rounded teaspoon Dijon or grained mustard
- 2 glasses full-bodied red wine
- 1 teaspoon redcurrant jelly
- salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Method

1. Melt half the butter in a frying pan with the olive oil over a medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for 3-4 minutes until tender. Remove from the pan and set aside.
1. Next, season the steaks, add to the pan and cook over a high heat for about 2 minutes on each side, if you like your steaks medium.
1. Remove from the pan and cover with foil. Return the mushrooms to the pan, add the orange zest, mustard, wine and redcurrant jelly, and bubble until reduced by half.
1. Whisk in the remaining butter, then add the steaks to heat through, season and serve.
