## Ingredients

- Â½ onion, finely chopped
- 50g chorizo, sliced
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 4 eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 tbsp milk
- 85g cooked, peeled prawns
- 100g frozen peas, defrosted

## Method

1. Heat grill to medium. In a 20cm frying pan, fry the onion and chorizo in the oil over a low heat. Cook for 4-5 mins, stirring occasionally until the onion is soft.
1. Take the pan off the heat, pour out any excess fat from the chorizo, then stir in the beaten eggs and milk with some seasoning. Stir in the prawns and peas and return to a low heat for 10-12 mins until all but the very top of the frittata is set. Flash it under the grill until golden.
