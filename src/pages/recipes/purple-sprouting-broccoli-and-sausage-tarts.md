## Ingredients

- 375g ready-rolled puff pastry
- 250g purple sprouting broccoli (also called broccoli rabe)
- olive oil
- 400g Italian-style pork sausages, skins removed and broken into chunks
- 1 tsp fennel seeds
- 1 tsp dried crushed chillies
- parmesan, grated to make 4 tbsp
- 200g cherry tomatoes, cut in half
- 2 balls of mozzarella (250g), drained and torn into pieces
- a small handful of basil leaves, torn

## Method

1. Cut the pastry to make 4 square tarts. Put on baking parchment and put in the freezer for 10 minutes.
1. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6 and put in two large baking sheets. Cut the broccoli into pieces and blanch for 2 minutes in salted boiling water. Rinse in cold water and drain well. Heat a non-stick pan with 1 tbsp olive oil and fry the sausage, fennel seeds, and chillies until the sausage is browned all over.
1. Keep each pastry square on the parchment paper and sprinkle the broccoli over the pastry leaving a 2cm border. Divide the sausage, Parmesan and tomato between the tarts. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and slide the tarts off the paper onto the hot trays. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the pastry is puffed and golden. In the last couple of minutes of cooking, top each tart with mozzarella and let melt. Remove from the oven and scatter the basil over. Serve while warm.
