## Ingredients

- 6 egg yolks
- 2 x 397 g tins condensed milk
- Freshly squeezed juice and grated zest of 8 unwaxed lemons
- 1 Basic Pie Crust, partially blind baked

### Meringue topping

- 8 egg whites
- 330 g caster sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 150°C.

2. Put the egg yolks, condensed milk, and lemon juice and zest in a glass bowl and mix gently with a balloon whisk until all the ingredients are very well incorporated. The mixture will thicken naturally.

3. Pour into the partially blind-baked pie crust and bake in the preheated oven for **20–30 minutes**. The filling should be firm to the touch but still very slightly soft in the centre (not wobbly!).

4. Leave to cool completely, then cover and refrigerate for at least **1 hour**, or overnight if possible.

### For the meringue topping

1. Preheat the oven to **150°C**.

2. Put the egg whites in a freestanding electric mixer with a whisk attachment and whisk until frothy. Gradually add 1–2 tablespoons of the sugar at a time, whisking well after each addition.

3. Once all the sugar has been added, add the vanilla extract and whisk again until stiff peaks form.

4. Spoon the meringue on top of the cold pie, making sure you completely cover the pie filling. Create peaks and swirls in the top of the meringue with the back of a tablespoon.

5. Bake in the pre-heated oven for about **20 minutes**, or until the meringue is golden brown and crisp to the touch.

6. Leave to cool completely before serving.
