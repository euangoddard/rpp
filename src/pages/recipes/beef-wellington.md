## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1.15kg thick fillet of beef, tied with string to keep its shape
- A generous knob of butter
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 100g chestnut mushrooms, finely chopped
- 3 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
- 500g packet puff pastry
- 1 egg, beaten (for glazing)
- 2 tsp plain flour
- 600ml chicken or lamb stock
- 6 tbsp red wine
- 1-2 tbsp Dijon mustard
- watercress and fresh herbs such as thyme and parsley to garnish

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 220°C/fan 200°C.
1. Heat the oil in a wide frying pan and fry the beef on a high heat browning all over. Put in a roasting tin and roast for 15 min for very rare, 20 mins for medium rare and 25-30 mins for medium to well done.
1. Heat the butter in a frying pan and fry the shallot and mushrooms for a few minutes until softened and no juices remain. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley. Season with salt and pepper and then leave to cool.
1. Remove the beef from the tin, keeping the juices, and put on a platter lined with kitchen paper, to absorb more juices. Set aside until cool enough to wrap in pastry. Remove the string.
1. Roll out the pastry on a work surface lightly dusted with flour. It needs to be wide and long enough to wrap around the beef comfortably - allow an extra 4cm of pastry at either end of the fillet and about 12cm either side. Save the pastry trimmings for decoration.
1. Spread the mushroom mixture lengthways down the centre of the pastry. Lay the fillet on the mushrooms and brush the pastry edges with egg. Bring the pastry ends over the ends of the beef, then bring the sides over so they overlap slightly and seal the edges.
1. Lay on a baking sheet, join underneath. Cut the pastry trimmings into two long strips anda few leaves. Brush the parcel with egg and attach the pastry strips in loops over the top, the leaves and brush with egg.
1. Bake for 35-40 mins until the pastry is puffed up and golden.
1. Meanwhile, make the gravy: heat the reserved meat juices in the roasting, stirring to scrape up any bits, then stir in the flour. Cook for a few minutes to brown. Pour in the stock and wine and bubble until reduced by a third and slightly thickened. Stir in the mustard to taste and season with salt and pepper if necessary.
1. Serve the beef on a plate garnished with watercress and herbs.
