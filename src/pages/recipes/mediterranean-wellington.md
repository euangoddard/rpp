## Ingredients

- 375g pack ready-rolled puff pastry

### 300g saffron risotto rice

- 300g risotto rice
- 900ml vegetable stock
- pinch saffron
- handful of grated vegetarian-style parmesan
- handful flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped
- handful basil, roughly chopped
- 1 egg, beaten
- 3 tbsp double cream
- 125g jar roasted red peppers
- 200g jar aubergines, drained
- 125g ball of buffalo mozzarella, drained and thinly sliced
- 200g jar artichokes drained and sliced, if thick
- 2 garlic cloves, sliced

## Method

1. Heat the oven to 200ÂºC. Roll out puff pastry into a square, roughly 35 x 35cm. Lay the pastry in a 22 x 12cm loaf tin, pressing into the corners and leaving extra to hang over the sides. Chill in fridge while you prepare filling.
1. Make the saffron risotto rice by covering the risotto rice with the stock and cooking for about 10 minutes with a pinch of saffron, stirring occasionally until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is nearly cooked. Stir a handful of parmesan through and allow to cool.
1. Once the rice is cool, mix with a beaten egg, cream, parsley and basil, then season to taste. Spoon half the mixture into the bottom of the loaf tin. Arrange the red peppers, aubergine, artichoke, mozzarella and garlic over the rice, followed by another layer of rice.
1. Fold the pastry over the top of the filling, cutting away any excess. Lightly wet your fingers and use to seal the pastry. You can make up to this point 1 day in advance and store in the fridge until needed.
1. Place the tin on a baking tray, then cook in the oven for 50 mins-1hr, until the pastry is golden. Leave to cool for 5 mins in the tin. Then, turn out onto a platter and slice using a serrated knife.
