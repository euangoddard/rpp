## Ingredients

- 140g bacon, diced
25g butter
4 leeks, thinly sliced
2 tsp thyme leaves
140g fontina or gruyere, cut into cubes (or any cheese you have)
1 large egg
500g puff pastry

## Method

1. Heat oven to 200ºC.
1. Fry the bacon until it is crisp then set aside.
1. Fry the leeks in the butter and thyme.
1. In a bowl mix together the bacon, cooked leeks, and cheese. Leave to cool.
1. Whisk the egg in a small bowel with 1tsp water to make a wash. Cut one third of the pastry off and roll out a 15cm x 30cm rectangle, then place on a baking sheet. Pile the leek mixture into the centre, leaving a 2cm surround. Roll the remaining pastry into a larger rectangle to cover the leek mixture easily. Brush the edges of the base with the egg wash, then carefully lay over the larger rectangle and smooth over to get rid of any excess air. Cut away any excess pastry to form a tidy edge ad glaze with egg wash. With the back of the fork, press to seal the edges.
1. You can now chill for 30 minutes and only now heat the oven.
1. Cook for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 180ºC and cook for 25-30 minutes until puffed up and golden brown.
1. Serve hot or cold.
