## Ingredients

### For the pancake batter

- 300g frozen corn, defrosted
- 2 eggs
- 50g plain flour
- 40g masa harina, or fine semolina
- 1 tbsp caster sugar
- 250ml milk
- flaky sea salt

### For the filling

- 300g firm/low-moisture mozzarella, roughly grated
- 180g feta, finely crumbled
- 80g spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced
- 1 fresh jalapeño chilli, finely chopped (discard the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat)
- 1 tsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 lime
- 2 tsp runny honey

## Method

1. Put all the batter ingredients in a blender, add a teaspoon of flaky salt and blitz smooth. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a tea towel and set aside for 15 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, put the two cheeses, spring onions, jalapeño and crushed coriander seeds in a bowl and mix well.
1. Put a medium, 18cm frying pan on a medium heat and, once hot, brush it with a little oil. Ladle in about 120ml of the batter, swirl the pan so the batter covers the base, then cook for three to four minutes, until the top is set and the bottom is deeply golden. Carefully flip over using a spatula, cook for another minute, then transfer to a large tray and repeat with the remaining batter, adding more oil to the pan as required.
1. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put roughly 90g of the filling into one half of each pancake, fold over, return to the tray, then bake for 10 minutes, until the cheese has melted.
1. Finely grate the lime zest over the tops of the pancakes, then drizzle over the honey. Sprinkle a pinch of flaky salt on top, cut the zested lime into wedges and serve alongside the pancakes.
