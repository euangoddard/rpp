## Ingredients

- 4 garlic cloves , crushed
- olive oil
- 2 x 400ml tins plum tomato, pureed
- 130g cubed pancetta
- 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 400g spring greens (the young ones are particularly nice)
- 8 sheets fresh or dried lasagne
- 200g soft goat's cheese
- 50g parmesan, grated

## Method

1. Heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. To make the sauce, fry 3/4 of the garlic in 3 tbsp olive oil until turning golden, add the pur√©ed tomatoes, cover and cook for about 10 minutes until thick.
1. In a separate pan, fry the pancetta in a little oil until crispy, then drain on kitchen paper. Add the onion and remaining garlic to the pan and cook until soft.
1. Meanwhile, tear the leaves from the stalks of the greens. Discard the stalks and cut the leaves into 2cm pieces. (If using young spring greens, chop everything as the stalks will be tender.) Add the greens to the onion and garlic and cook for about 5 minutes until tender. Remove from the heat and add the pancetta.
1. If using dried pasta, boil the sheets until al dente, drain and rinse with cold water. Lay out the fresh or cooked pasta sheets and divide the greens mixture between them, putting the filling in the middle of each lengthways. Top with most of the goat's cheese. Roll up, pressing the edges together to secure. Spoon some sauce into a 20cm x 18cm dish and add the cannelloni, join-side down. Pour more of the sauce around the sides, covering the pasta three quarters of the way. Sprinkle Parmesan and the remaining goat's cheese over the top and bake for 20 minutes.
