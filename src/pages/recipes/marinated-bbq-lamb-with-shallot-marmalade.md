## Ingredients

- 4 cannons of lamb, about 170-200g each
- approx. 350mls olive oil
- 2 bulbs fennel, trimmed and cut into 8 slices
- 4 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 bunch asparagus, cut in half lengthways
- 2 red peppers, cut into 2 cm strips
- 6-8 sprigs of thyme
- 4 slices of sour dough

### For the marinade

- juice of 1 lemon
- 2 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 fat garlic clove, crushed
- fennel tops, chopped
- handful mint leaves, roughly chopped

### For the shallot marmalade

- 8 shallots, halved and sliced
- 4 fat cloves garlic, sliced
- 3 cm cube fresh ginger, peeled and grated
- 1 tsp mild curry powder
- 2 tsp golden caster sugar
- 3 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 3-4 tbsp creme fraiche

## Method

1. Make the marinade - in a bowl, whisk together 150ml olive oil, lemon juice, mustard, garlic, fennel tops and mint, a good pinch sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper. Pour over the meat and set aside for at least 30 mins.
1. Heat a frying pan over a high heat, add the shallots, garlic, ginger, curry powder, sugar, 4 tbsp oil and fry for 2-3 mins, stirring until caramelised. Turn down heat and add leaves from 4 thyme sprigs. Season and cook on medium heat for about 15 mins, stirring occasionally.
1. Deglaze with wine vinegar, cook for another 5 mins, then stir in the crème fraîche and cook 2-3 mins. You should have a creamy soft mixture. Set aside to cool. The marmalade will keep in the fridge for up to 3 days.
1. Sprinkle the bread slices with crushed salt, more thyme leaves and lightly drizzle some oil.
1. Lift meat from the marinade and lightly shake to remove any excess marinade. Place on the hot griddle (take care, as the griddle will flame up) and cook 6-7 mins each side, moving to the side of the grill if they start to burn. Remove cooked meat and leave to rest for 10 mins.
1. Griddle vegetables starting with the fennel, allowing 3 mins each side until chargrilled and lightly softened. Then cook asparagus for 4-5 mins turning once, the pepper strips (3-4 mins) and finally the bread until lightly toasted.
1. Slice the meat thinly lengthways. Spread the toast with shallot marmalade, top with the lamb and serve with the vegetables alongside.
