## Ingredients


### For the sponge

- 225g unsalted butter, softened
- 225g caster sugar
- 4 large eggs, room temperature
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 225g self raising-flour, sifted
- 1 tbsp milk, room temperature

### For the filling

- 6 rounded tbsp good raspberry jam

### To finish

- caster or icing sugar

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees.
1. Put the soft butter into a mixing bowl and beat with a wooden spoon or electric mixer for a minute until very smooth and creamy.
1. Gradually beat in the sugar, then keep on beating for 3-4 mins or until the mixture almost turns white and becomes very fluffy in texture.
1. Break the eggs into a small bowl, add the vanilla and beat lightly with a fork just to break them up. Slowly add to the creamed mixture, a tbsp at a time, giving the mixture a good beat each time. If the mixture looks like it is about to curdle, add a tbsp of the sifted flour and then continue to add the egg mixture.
1. Sift the flour again, this time into the mixture. Add the milk and gently, but thoroughly fold the flour into the egg mixture using a large metal spoon.
1. Spoon the mixture into two tins, so they are filled equally.
1. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a good golden brown and the sponges are springy when gently pressed with a fingertip.
1. Turn out onto a wire rack to cool. When ready, spread one of the sponges with raspberry jam and then place the other sponge on top. Dust with sugar.
