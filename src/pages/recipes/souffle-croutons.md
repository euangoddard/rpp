## Ingredients

- 75g full fat Cream Cheese
- 150g butter
- 150g grated cheddar
- White loaf crust cut off
- Salt and Pepper
- 2 large egg whites

## Method

1. Line 2-3 baking sheets with non stick baking parchment.
1. Melt the cream cheese, butter and grated cheese in a pan over a low heat until completely melted (don’t worry, it will look curdles at this stage). Whisk the egg whites until stiff, fold carefully into the cheese mixture, season with salt & pepper.
1. Cut the bread into 1” cubes. Dip the cubes, speared with cocktail stick into the souffled mixture until coated, swirl the stick around carefully. Transfer to the baking sheets leaving a small gap between each cube. Put in freezer until needed.
1. Bake in oven, pre-heated to Gas Mark 7 for 10-12 mins. Until golden brown and puffed up. Turn over after about 6 mins, serve at once.
