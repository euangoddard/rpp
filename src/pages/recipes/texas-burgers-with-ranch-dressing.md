## Ingredients

- 1 small onion, finely chopped 
- sunflower oil, for frying 
- 1 tsp dried oregano 
- 1 tsp ground cumin 
- 1 tsp paprika 
- 500g minced beef 
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 
- 1 egg , lightly beaten 

### For the dressing:

- 6 tbsp mayonnaise 
- 1 fat garlic clove, crushed 
- a small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, chopped 
- a small bunch of dill, chopped 
- a large pinch of onion powder or granules (optional) 

## Method

1. Stir the ranch dressing ingredients together in a bowl with seasoning. Cover and chill until needed. 
1. To make the burgers, gently fry the onion in 1 tbsp oil with the oregano, cumin and paprika. When soft, transfer to a large bowl and cool. Add the beef, Worcestershire sauce and season. Mix well and add just enough egg to bind the meat together. Form into 8 burgers about 1 cm thick. Chill until needed (you can make these a day ahead). 
1. Grill the burgers over medium-hot coals, about 5-6 minutes each side for medium, 8-9 minutes for well-done. Split and lightly toast burger buns. 
1. Lay a couple of lettuce leaves and a slice of tomato on the base of each bun and add a dollop of ranch dressing. Top with a burger, relish and gherkins.
