## Ingredients


### For the sauce:

- olive oil
- 1 small onions, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 2 x 400g tins tomatoes
- S+P
- red wine vinegar

### For the meatballs:

- 400g tuna
- olive oil
- 55g pinenuts
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- S+P
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- handful fresh chopped parsley
- 100g breadcrumbs
- 55g grated parmesan
- 2 eggs

## Method

1. First make the tuna meatballs, as they need to rest for an hour after they are made. Chop the tuna up and then fry with the pinenuts and cinnamon. Season with salt and pepper and fry until the tuna is coloured on all sides and the pinenuts are toasted. Remove from the heat and put in a bowl.
1. When the tuna is cool, add the oregano, parsley, breadcrumbs, parmesan, eggs, lemon zest and juice. Mix together and then make into golf ball sized meatballs. Put them in the fridge for an hour.
1. Make the sauce by frying the onion and garlic slowly for about 10 minutes. Add the oregano, tomatoes, salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Simmer for 15 minutes, then liquidise until smooth. Add red wine vinegar and other seasoning to taste.
1. Meanwhile, fry the meatballs separately until they are golden brown all over, and then add them to the tomato sauce.
