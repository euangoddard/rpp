## Ingredients

- 114g self raising flour
- 57g butter
- 1 level tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 1 rounded tsp ginger
- 42g caster sugar
- 2 tbsp golden syrup

## Method

1. Mix flour, ginger and bicarb, rub in butter to make 'breadcrumbs' stir in sugar and then mix to a dough with golden syrup.
1. Split the dough into 16 equal pieces and roll into balls. Place on a baking tray leaving space to spread (so can only usually fit 8 on one tray) and bake at 180C until golden brown = 10-15mins. When you take them out of the oven leave to cool on the baking tray for 10 mins then on wire rack until cold.
