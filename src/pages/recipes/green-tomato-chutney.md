## Ingredients

- 2Â½ kg green tomatoes
- 500g onions
- 1 rounded tbsp salt
- 500g sultanas
- 500g cooking apples
- 500g light muscovado sugar
- 1.14 litre jar spiced pickling vinegar

## Method

1. Slice the tomatoes (you can skin them if you want, but I don't usually bother). Finely chop the onions. Layer both in a large bowl with the salt. Leave overnight.
1. Next day, chop the sultanas using a large, sharp knife, then peel, core and chop the apples. Put the sugar and vinegar into a large pan and bring to the boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the sultanas and apples and simmer for 10 mins. Strain the tomatoes and onions in a colander (but don't rinse), then tip into the pan and return to the boil.
1. Simmer for about 1 hr, stirring occasionally until the mixture is thick and pulpy. Transfer to warmed jars and cover with lids.
