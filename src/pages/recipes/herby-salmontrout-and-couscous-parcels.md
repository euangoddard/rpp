## Ingredients

- 110g pack lemon and garlic couscous
- 200ml hot vegetable stock
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- handful chopped fresh herbs (parsley + thyme, tarragon or rosemary)
- 4 spring onions, thinly sliced
- 4 sun dried tomatoes, chopped
- 2 salmon/trout fillets

## Method

1. Put the couscous into a bowl and stir in the stock and oil. Leave to stand until all the moisture has been absorbed and then fluff up with a fork. Keeping back some of the herbs, add the rest of the ingredients except the fish. Season to taste.
1. Cut two large sheets of non-stick baking parchment and divide the couscous between them. Sit each fillet on the couscous and top with the remaining herbs and season. Fold the paper over, then twist the edges to seal. Pop each parcel separately into the microwave for 3 minutes on high and then leave to stand for 2 minutes. Serve in the bag.
1. If cooking in the oven: Heat oven to 200ÂºC. Pop the parcels on to a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes or until the fish feels firm through the paper.
