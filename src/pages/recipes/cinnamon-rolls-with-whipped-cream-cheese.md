- Butter: 74g

### Cinnamon Roll Filling

### Whipped Cream Cheese Icing

- 245g icing sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 300ml extra thick double cream

## Method

1. To make the dough, mix dry ingredients together. Add wet ingredients and mix. Knead. Warning: this makes an extremely sticky dough. You're supposed to knead it until becomes not too sticky. However you can just add additional flour until it's good to work with.
1. Roll into ball and put in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with cling film, let it rise until double in size.
1. When dough is ready, roll out into as rectangular shape as possible onto grease proof paper, thickness is at your discretion
1. Mix all the above Cinnamon Roll Filling ingredients together.
1. Melt some butter and spread the surface of the dough with it, then spread the Cinnamon mix evenly over whole surface
1. Roll up the dough along long edge. Cut into sections, again thickness is your preference.
1. Put sections into baking dish(es) cover with cling film, let the dough rise again. For extra fluffy/soft buns leave to rise over night.
1. Cook at 175 Celsius for 30 minutes or until done
1. To make the icing, beat cheese, sugar and vanilla together until fluffy. Separately beat the cream until thick. Combine the two, beat to mix but don't over do it. Slap Icing on Buns. Eat!
