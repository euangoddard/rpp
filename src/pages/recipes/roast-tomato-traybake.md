## Ingredients

### For the Marinade

- 3 tsp honey
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp water
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp coriander seeds, lightly crushed
- 1 tsp nigella seeds (or cumin seeds)
- 1 tsp red chilli flakes or 1 tsp Aleppo pepper

### For the Traybake

- 225g block of halloumi
- 400g new potatoes (preferably Jerseys), scrubbed
- 300g cherry tomatoes
- 1 large leek (about 150g), sliced thickly
- _(Optional)_ 160g cooking chorizo, cut into 1cm thick slices
- 8 cloves garlic, skin on
- 200g frozen peas (any chunks broken up)
- 1 tbsp mint, finely chopped

## Method

1. **Marinate the Halloumi:**  
   In a bowl, whisk together the honey, olive oil, water, mustard, and lemon juice with the seeds and chilli flakes.  
   Slice the halloumi into 1.5 cm slices and toss into the marinade. Leave for at least 30 minutes.

2. **Prepare Vegetables & Preheat Oven:**  
   Preheat oven to 180°C / 200°C (non-fan) and lightly grease a 26cm x 37cm roasting tray.  
   Boil the potatoes in well-salted water until fork tender, then drain. Allow to steam dry.  
   Chop any large potatoes into bite-sized chunks.  
   Toss potatoes into the roasting tray along with the cherry tomatoes, leek, (chorizo if using), and garlic cloves.

3. **Assemble Traybake:**  
   Remove halloumi from marinade.  
   Drizzle 4 tablespoons of the marinade over the tray ingredients and toss everything together by hand to coat well.  
   Arrange halloumi on top and season.

4. **Roast:**  
   Roast for 22–25 minutes (watch the halloumi—flip if edges get too dark).  
   Add frozen peas and toss them through the dish.  
   If using whole cherry tomatoes, gently press them to release their juices.  
   Return to oven for another 5 minutes.

5. **Serve:**  
   Divide between bowls, spooning juices over each. Garnish with chopped mint.  
   Serve with remaining marinade for drizzling if desired.  
   Great with crusty bread for mopping.
