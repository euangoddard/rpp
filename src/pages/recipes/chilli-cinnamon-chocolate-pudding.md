## Ingredients

- 150g plain flour
- 2 tsps baking powder
- 1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp chilli powder
- 200g caster sugar
- 50g cocoa
- 125ml milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 60ml corn oil
- 100g soft, dark brown sugar
- 175ml boiling water
- 60ml dark rum

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees.
1. In a a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, a pinch of salt, cinnamon, chilli, caster sugar and half the cocoa.
1. Beat the milk, vanilla and corn oil together in a measuring jug and pour this into the dry ingredients. Mix it with a wooden spoon to make a thick, smooth batter. Then spoon into a 2L round oven-proof dish.
1. Combine the remaining 25g of cocoa and the dark brown sugar in another bowl, making sure there are no lumps. Sprinkle this over the top of the cake batter in the dish.
1. Measure out 175ml of freshly boiled water and pour it over the cocoa/sugar topped batter. Tip over the dark rum and put the pudding in the oven.
1. Cook for 30 minutes, by which time the top of the cake should have set to a bubbly, chocolatey sponge, but underneath will be wobbly and liquid.
