## Ingredients

- 1.6kg dry-cured smoked gammon joint

### For the glaze

- 300ml pineapple juice
- 1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
- 3cm piece of fresh ginger, peeled and grated
- 1 tsp garlic granules
- 200ml tomato ketchup
- 3 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 3 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 3 tbsp dark brown sugar
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper

## Method

1. Put the gammon in a large pan and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil and skim off any scum that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours. Leave to cool in the cooking liquid for 30 mins and then drain.
1. Meanwhile, make the glaze. Tip all the ingredients into a pan and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and bubble for 10-12 mins or until just syrupy.
1. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Sit the gammon on a board and, using a sharp knife, cut away the skin, leaving behind an even layer of fat. Score the fat all over in a criss-cross pattern.
1. Transfer the gammon to a roasting tin and roast for 10 mins. Remove from the oven and brush the glaze all over the gammon.
1. Continue to roast, bastin every 5-10 mins with the glaze, for about 40 mins.
1. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 15 mins before carving. Serve with the remaining glaze on the side.
