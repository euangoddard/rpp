## Ingredients

- 125 g Unsalted Butter
- 100 g Light Brown Soft Sugar
- 75 g White Granulated Sugar
- 1 Large/Medium Egg
- 1 tsp Vanilla
- 275 g Plain Flour
- 1 tbsp cornflour
- 1 + 1/2 tsp Baking Powder
- 1/2 tsp Bicarbonate of Soda
- 1/2 tsp Sea Salt
- 100 g Dairy milk (chopped finely) (or chocolate chips)
- 200 g Mini Eggs (chopped)
- 50 g Mini Eggs (whole)

## Method

1. Add the unsalted butter, light brown soft sugar and white granulated sugar to a bowl and beat until creamy.
1. Add in the egg and vanilla, and beat again.
1. Add in the plain flour, cornflour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt and beat until a cookie dough is formed.
1. Add in the chopped dairy milk and chopped mini eggs and mix in until they are distributed well in the cookie dough.
1. Weigh the cookies out into eight cookie dough balls - they're about 115g each.
1. Once they're rolled into balls, add the whole mini eggs into the cookie dough balls and put the cookie dough in the freezer for at least 30 minutes, or in the fridge for an hour or so.
1. Whilst the cookie dough is chilling, preheat your oven to 180C Fan, or 200C regular! If your oven runs hot, go for 160C-170C.
1. Take the cookies out of the freezer/fridge and put onto lined baking trays.
1. Bake the cookies in the oven for 12-14 minutes.
1. Once baked, leave them to cool on the tray for at least 30 minutes, as they will continue to bake whilst cooling!
