## Ingredients

- 450g parsnips, peeled, quartered and any woody centres removed
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 50ml milk
- 500ml vegetable stock

### For the chestnut cream

- 4-6 tbsp chestnut puree
- 100ml milk
- 100ml single cream
- grated nutmeg
- 6-8 cooked chestnuts, chopped (optional)

### For the parsnip croutons

- 1 large parsnip

## Method

1. Put the quartered parsnips and onion in a saucepan with the milk and vegetable stock. Bring them a simmer and cook gently for 20-25 mins until parsnips are tender. Blend in a liquidizer until completely smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Can be frozen for up to 1 month at this point.
1. If making croutons, do so while the soup simmers. Cut off long, thin slices of parsnip using a vegetable peeler or similar. Fry in a little hot vegetable oil for a few minutes until golden all over. Drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with salt. They will crisp up as they cool.
1. For the chestnut cream, warm together the chestnut puree, milk and single cream then season with salt, pepper and a pinch of grated nutmeg. Blitz with the chestnut cream with a hand blender for a frothy finish.
1. Ladle soup into bowls, scatter chopped chestnuts over the top, then finish with frothy chestnut cream. Arrange a pile of parsnip croutons besides each bowl or decorate the soup with them.
