## Ingredients

- 100g butter, melted, plus extra for greasing
- 300g pack ginger nut biscuits
- 100ml whipping cream
- 250g tub mascarpone
- 350g full-fat soft cheese
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 75g icing sugar
- 2 × 150g packs raspberries
- 15g shelled pistachios, toasted and roughly chopped (optional)

## Method

1. **Make the base:**
   Grease and line the base of a 20cm round springform tin. Blitz the ginger nuts to fine crumbs in a food processor (or put in a freezer bag and bash with a rolling pin). Stir in the melted butter to coat, then tip into the prepared tin and press firmly into the base and about 4cm up the sides using the back of a spoon. Transfer to the fridge to chill until needed.

2. **Make the filling:**
   Whip the cream until soft peaks form. Add the mascarpone, soft cheese and vanilla to a separate bowl; sieve in the icing sugar and beat with a wooden spoon until combined. Stir through the cream. Mash 200g raspberries in a shallow bowl with a fork, then gently fold through the mascarpone mix to ripple.

3. **Assemble:**
   Spoon the mascarpone mixture over the biscuit base, levelling the top. Return to the fridge to chill for at least 5–6 hrs or overnight until firm.

4. **Serve:**
   To serve, remove the cheesecake from the tin, running a sharp knife around the edge to loosen. Transfer to a serving plate, top with the remaining raspberries and scatter with the pistachios to serve, if you like.
