## Ingredients

- 85g cheese - cheddar, gruyere, gouda, mozzarella
- 85g stoned green olibes
- 55g sun-dried tomatoes
- 50g canned anchony fillets
- 55g sun-dried tomato paste
- flour, for dusting
- 500g puff pastry
- beaten egg, to glaze

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees.
1. Put all the ingredients, apart from the pastry and egg, into a food processor and roughly chop.
1. Roll out the pastry and cut into 8cm rounds. Pile the trimmings together, roll out again and repeat.
1. Put 1 tsp of the olive filling in the middle of each pastry round. Dampen the edges with a little water and pinch the edges to seal - like little Cornish pasties.
1. Glaze with the eggs and bake for 10-15 mins until golden brown. Serve hot or cold.
