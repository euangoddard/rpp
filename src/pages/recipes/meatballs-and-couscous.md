## Method

1. Make the stew. Add the white onions, half the carrots, celery and garlic to a food processor. Process to a fine mush (or you can chop it all very finely by hand). 
1. Fry the mixed vegetable until softened.
1. Add the red onion to the cooking vegetables. Stir around for a few minutes. Add the rest of the vegetables and let them all soften.
1. Sprinkle over all the spices, except the harissa.
1. Add the apricots and the tins of tomatoes.
1. Add the chicken stock and the harissa pasta. Bring to the boil before putting on a lid and simmering for an hour.
1. Make the meatballs. Mix everything together. Cover with clingfilm and leave in the fridge for 30 minutes.
1. Scoop out small amounts – heaped ½ tsp or scant tsp – roll them in your hands and place them aside.
1. To cook, fry in batches.
1. Cook the couscous. Mix the dry ingredients together and then add the boiling water. Leave to stand for 15 minutes before fluffing with a fork.
1. Heat the meatballs in the stew. Serve with the couscous.
