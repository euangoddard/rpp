## Ingredients


### Filling 

- 450g Bramley’s Apples, peeled, cored and thinly sliced
- 25g butter
- 250g blueberries
- 85g golden caster sugar
- 250g tub mascarpone

### Slump

- 85g butter, cut into pieces
- 200g self-raising flour
- 50g golden caster sugar
- zest of one lemon
- 150ml milk

## Method

1. Butter a 1.5 litre ovenproof dish. 
1. Heat the butter in a frying pan and fry the apple slices for 3-4 mins until they are just beginning to soften.
1. Tip into the ovenproof dish, along with the blueberries and sugar. Mix lightly and set aside.
1. For the slump, rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles fine crumbs, the stir in the sugar and the lemon zest (this mixture can then be covered for several hours before baking).
1. Preheat oven to 180°C.
1. Make a well in the centre of the dry slump mix and add the milk. Mix lightly to form a soft mixture.
1. Spoon blobs of the mascarpone over the surface of the fruit. Spoon the slump mixture on top and bake for 20-25 mins until the topping is risen and forms a craggy, golden crust. Leave to cool for 10-15 mins before serving.
