## Ingredients

- 350g courgettes, trimmed
- 110g soft cream cheese
- freshly grated nutmeg
- 50g white bread
- 25g butter, cubed
- 25g grated parmesan
- salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200ÂºC
1. Coarsely grate the courgettes, then put them into a large sieve and press down firmly with a wooden spoon to squeeze out as much liquid as possible.
1. Combine the courgettes in a bowl with the cream cheese, adding nutmeg and seasoning  to taste.
1. Divide between buttered ramekin dishes, pressing down firmly to within 5mm of the top.
1. Make the crumble topping next. Whiz the bread in a processor to make fine crumbs, then add the butter and parmesan and quickly blend again until the butter is well mixed in. Sprinkle the topping over the courgette mixture to evenly cover the surface.
1. Place on a baking tray and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 15-20 min until golden brown. Serve hot.
