## Ingredients

- 50g. Butter
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- 900g. Jerusalem artichokes, peeled and cut into slices
- 1 litre Vegetable stock
- Med. Carton Single cream

## Method

1. Melt the butter in a large saucepan, add the onion and cook over a low heat until soft, not coloured.
1. Add the garlic and artichokes, stir and cook for 2-3 minutes until slightly softened.
1. Add the stock, bring to boil and then simmer, partially covered for about 30 min or until the vegetables are soft.
1. Ladle into a food processor/liquidiser in batches and puree until smooth.
1. Tip into a sieve, resting over a bowl and force the puree through, this will strain out any fibrous bits of the artichoke.
1. Return the soup to a clean pan and add cream and season with salt and pepper. Do not boil, but heat through gently.
1. If you want to freeze the soup do not add cream, but add when defrosted.
