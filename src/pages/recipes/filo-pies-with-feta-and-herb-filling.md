## Ingredients

- 225 g packet filo pastry
- olive oil, for brushing

### Filling:

- 300 g feta cheese
- 60 ml (4 tbsp) pine nuts, toasted
- 30 ml (2 tbsp) chopped fresh parsley or coriander
- 15 ml (1 tbsp) chopped fresh dill
- ½ egg, lightly beaten
- pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
- pepper

## Method

1. First prepare the filling. Crumble the cheese into a bowl and add the pine nuts, herbs, egg, nutmeg and pepper to taste. Mix well.
1. Cut the filo pastry sheets into strips, measuring about 10 x 25 cm. Keep covered with a damp cloth while not in use to prevent them drying out.
1. Working with 3 or 4 filo sheets at a time, brush with oil and place a heaped teaspoonful of filling at the top right-hand corner of each strip. Fold the corner down to make a triangle and continue to flip the filled triangle down the length of the filo strip to wrap in the pastry. Place the filo triangles on a greased baking sheet and brush with a little more oil. Repeat to use all of the filo strips and filling.
1. Bake the filo pies in the oven (190ºC/175ºC fan) for 20-25 minutes until crisp and deep golden in colour. Serve hot or warm.
