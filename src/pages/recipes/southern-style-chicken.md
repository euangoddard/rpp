## Ingredients

- 2 chicken drumsticks, skin on
- 2 chicken thigh portions, skin on, bone in
- 1 litre full fat milk
- salt
- 125g plain flour
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 egg, beaten
- 500g solid vegetable fat for frying

## Method

1. Put the chicken pieces into a dish into which they fit snugly. Pour over the milk to cover and sprinkle over with some salt. Cover with cling film and leave in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.
1. Tip the cotnents of the dish into a pan with a lid and bring to the boil, turning it down to simmer, until the chicken pieces are cooked through.
1. Remove the chicken pieces to a rack and let cool. 
1. Put the flour, cayenne and some salt into a plastic bag. Shake all the pieces of chicken in it one by one, then dip into the egg and then into the flour again. Leave to dry in the rack for about 15 minutes.
1. Heat the great white slab of vegetable fat in a frying pan until it's nearly at smoking point. Lower in the chicken pieces and cook for a minute or so each side until the skin crisps and turns golden brown.
