## Ingredients

- 250g unsalted butter, softened
- 140g sugar
- 1 egg yolk
- Grated zest of 1 clementine
- 300g flour
- 411g jar fruit mincemeat

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/gas 4 and line 2 baking trays with greaseproof paper.
1. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl until creamy. Add the egg yolk and clementine zest and beat again to combine.
1. Sift in the flour then fold through most of the mincemeat and stir until the mixture starts to come together â€“ use your hands to make a dough, if needed.
1. Pull off little biscuit-sized clumps of dough, space them evenly over the trays and gently press down slightly to shape into cookies. Dot a little of your saved mince on top of each cookie
1. Put them in the oven for 10 minutes, or till golden but still a bit doughy in the middle.
1. Serve warm, or turn onto a wire rack to cool, then store in an airtight container.
