## Ingredients

- 1oz butter
- 4 boned and skinned chicken breasts
- 1 tbsp oil
- 4oz Wensleydale/other cheese (approx)
- 4 slices of thin ham
- 1lb puff pastry (frozen or fresh)
- 1 egg (beaten)

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 190ÂºC (fan assist)
1. Melt the butter and oil in a pan and fry the chicken breasts gently until sealed. Remove the chicken from the pan and leave to cool.
1. Roll out the pastry and cut into 4 large circles (using a plate which has a diameter slightly larger than the length of the breast). Brush the edges with the beaten egg. Place a chicken breast on each, then put a slice of Wensleydale cheese on top and finally wrap with the thin ham. Fold the pastry over and seal well. Brush with the beaten egg.
1. Place on a baking sheet and cook for 18-22 minutes until the pastry is golden brown.
