## Ingredients

- 100g butter
- 100g light muscovado sugar
- 4 tbsp golden syrup
- 100g pecans, half of them chopped, the other half reserved
- 350g unsweetened muesli (best if not sweetened and with not too much fruit)
- 1 medium ripe banana, mashed

## Method

1. Heat oven to 180ÂºC. Butter and line the base of an 18x25cm tin with baking parchment.
1. Melt the butter, sugar and syrup together on a low heat. Stir until the butter is melted and the sugar has dissolved.
1. Tip the muesli, banana and chopped nuts into the pan and stir until everything is well mixed. Spoon into the prepared tin and press down firmly with a spoon until it is firmly packed.
1. Scatter the whole nuts over the top and press lightly into the mixture. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the muesli turns dark golden and the edges have started to crisp.
1. Leave until cool and then cut into about 12 slices.
