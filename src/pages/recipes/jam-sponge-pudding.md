## Ingredients

- 50g strawberry or raspberry jam
- 175g butter, softened, plus extra for greasing
- 50g golden syrup
- 62.5g caster sugar
- 3 free-range eggs, lightly beaten
- 175g self-raising flour

## Method

1. Generously butter the inside of two 1.2 litre/2 pint pudding basins.
1. Spoon the jam into the base of the pudding basin and set aside.
1. Beat the butter, golden syrup and sugar together in a mixer until light and fluffy.
1. Beat in half the eggs followed by half the flour and when well combined, add the remaining eggs and flour. The mixture should be at a dropping consistency. Add a splash of milk if the mixture is too thick.
1. Spoon the mixture into the pudding basins, only filling them three quarters full, then smooth the surface with the back of a spoon.
1. Loosely cover with cling film, allowing room for the cling film to inflate as the mixture rises, and cook in the microwave for five minutes.The pudding is done when a skewer inserted into the centre of the pudding comes out clean.
1. Leave to stand for five minutes then run a blunt knife around the edge of the pudding to loosen the sides, carefully invert onto a deep plate and remove the basin.
1. To serve, spoon the extra jam over the pudding, cut into generous wedges and serve with custard.
