## Ingredients

- 4 eggs, yolks and whites separated
- 310g/11oz ricotta
- 190ml/6½fl oz milk
- 255g/9oz plain flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- pinch of salt
- 310g/11oz blueberries
- 110g/4oz sugar
- 85g/3oz butter
- extra blueberries to garnish

## Method

1. Place the egg yolks, ricotta and milk in a large mixing bowl and stir to combine.
1. Sieve in the flour, baking powder and salt and mix well with the ricotta mixture.
1. Whisk the egg whites to a soft peak. Add a third of the egg whites to the ricotta mixture and stir in to loosen the mixture. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites.
1. Add one third of the blueberries to the batter and stir in. 
1. Place the remaining blueberries in a small pan with the sugar and half the butter and simmer for a couple of minutes so that some of the berries have collapsed.
1. Melt the remaining butter in a frying pan and add a ladle of the batter to the pan. Once the pancake bubbles a bit, after about 1-2 minutes, turn the pancake over and cook on the other side. Repeat until all the batter is used up.
1. Serve by placing three pancakes on top of each other and drizzle some of the blueberry compôte over the pancakes and plate.
1. Finally put a scoop of crème fraîche on the pile of pancakes. Garnish with a few fresh blueberries.
