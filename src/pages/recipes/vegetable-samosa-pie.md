## Ingredients

- 500g new potatoes, cut into bite sized chunks
- 350g sweet potato, peeled and cut into bite-sized chinks
- 1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- ½ tsp turmeric
- pinch cayenne pepper
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1-2 green chillies, deseeded and finely chopped
- 1 small piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated
- 150g peas, cooked
- 4-5 heaped tbsp fresh coriander, roughly chopped
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 2 medium eggs, lightly beaten
- 75g butter
- 200g filo pastry

## Method

1. You will need a 23cm diameter sandwich tin or loose bottom flan tin
1. Cook the potatoes and sweet potato through (the sweet potato won't take as long). Drain and allow to cool.
1. Fry the onion in a little oil until beginning to brown. Add the cumin seeds and stir for 1 min, then add the ground cumin, coriander, turmeric and cayenne. Cook for another few seconds then stir stir in the garlic chilli and ginger.
1. Now add the peas and 3 tbsp water and simmer for 5 mins.
1. Add the cooked potatoes and heat through for a couple of minutes, then crush them roughly with a fork. Stir in the coriander and lemon juice. Check seasoning.
1. Take the pan off the heat for a few minutes and then stir in the eggs. Leave to cool
1. Pre-heat the oven to 190°C. Melt the butter and then brush the tin you are using. Unroll 5 sheets of the filo pastry and brush each one with melted butter. Lay these at different angle across the base of the tin to cover all the way up the sides.
1. Spoon in the filling, packing it down evenly. Layer up 6 more sheets of buttered pastry on top of the pie and fold over the edges to seal thoroughly. Brush the topping with the melted butter.
1. Cut a couple of slits in the top of the pie and bake for 45-50 mins until well browned.
