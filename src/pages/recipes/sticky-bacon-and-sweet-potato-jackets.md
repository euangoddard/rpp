## Ingredients

- 4 medium sweet potatoes
- 8 rashers bacon
- bunch of spring onion, chopped
- 200g can sweet corn, drained
- 3 tbsp maple syrup or honey
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard

## Method

1. Pierce the skin of the sweet potatoes with a fork, then microwave on high for 10-12 mins until soft. If you halve the recipes, reduce the cooking time to 6-8 mins.
1. Chop the bacon into chunky pieces, then fry in a small amount of oil until cooked.
1. Meanwhile, halve the potatoes lengthways and scoop out a third of the flesh from each half into a mixing bowl. Place the potato skins on a baking sheet. Add the bacon to the sweet potato flesh and then add the remaining ingredients and some seasoning, mixing well. 
1. Spoon the mixture back into the potato halves, and grill until golden.
