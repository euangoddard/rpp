## Ingredients

- 375g pack ready rolled short crust pastry
- 500g mascarpone
- 100g golden caster sugar
- 100g ground almonds
- 2 large eggs
- 250g fresh raspberries
- 100g white chocolate, roughly chopped

## Method

1. Heat oven to 160ºC/fan 140ºC/gas 4
1. Roll out your pastry as needed to line a 30x20cm tin or a Swiss roll tin. Line the pastry with greaseproof paper, fill with baking beans and cook for 10 mins. Take out the beans and paper, then return to the oven for a further 5 mins.
1. Whisk together the mascarpone, sugar, almonds and eggs until well blended. Fold in the raspberries and chocolate, and then pour into the tin with the cooked pastry.
1. Bake for 20-25 minutes until just set and golden. Turn off the oven, open the door and leave the tray bake to cool gradually.
1. For best results, chill for at least an hour before slicing.
