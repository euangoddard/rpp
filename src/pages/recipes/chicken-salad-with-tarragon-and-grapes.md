## Ingredients

- 1 cooked chicken, about 3 lb (1.35 kg) or 33/4 lb (1.7 kg) raw weight 
- 1 heaped teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon 
- 4 oz (110 g) seedless green grapes, halved 
- 5 fl oz (150 ml) mayonnaise, preferably home-made 
- 3 fl oz (75 ml) double cream
- 1 teaspoon wholegrain mustard
- 3 spring onions, finely chopped 
- 1 small lettuce, washed and allowed to dry 
- few sprigs watercress
- a handful of cherry tomatoes

## Method

1. Remove the skin from the chicken and slice the flesh into longish pieces where possible. Remove all the chicken from the bones and place all the meat in a bowl, seasoning with salt and pepper.
1. In a separate bowl, mix the mayonnaise thoroughly with the cream and mustard, adding the chopped tarragon and finely chopped spring onions.
1. Now pour the sauce over the chicken, mix it well so that all the chicken pieces get a good coating, then arrange it on a plate of crisp lettuce leaves and garnish with green grapes, cherry tomatoes and a few sprigs of watercress.
