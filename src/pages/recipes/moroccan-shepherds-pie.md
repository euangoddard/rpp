## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 onions, thinly sliced
- 900g lean minced lamb
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 3cm root ginger, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp each ground coriander, cumin, paprika
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 425ml/3/4 pint vegetable stock
- 100g ready to eat dried apricots, chopped
- juice of half a lemon
- For the topping:
- 1 kg waxy potatoes
- large pinch saffron
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 garlic clove, chopped

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200ÂºC.
1. Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the onions and fry for 10 minutes. Remove from the pan, then add the lamb and fry on a fairly high heat until browned all over. Return the onions to the pan with the garlic and ginger, then stir in the spices and season with salt and pepper.
1. Stir in the stock and bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir in the apricots and cook for a further 20 minutes until the liquid thickens and the meat is tender.
1. Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into cubes 1 inch long and put them in a pan with water to cover. Add the salt and saffron and bring to the boil. Cover and cook for 20 minutes until tender. Drain well, then return to the pan and crush roughly with a fork. Stir in the oil, garlic and coriander until well combined.
1. Taste the lamb mixture and add more salt and pepper if necessary. Stir in the lemon juice and spoon all of the lamb mixture into a 2 litre oven-proof dish. Spoon the potatoes evenly over the top. Bake for 30 minutes until the potatoes are crisp and brown on top.
