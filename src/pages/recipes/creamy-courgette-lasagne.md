## Ingredients

- 9 dried lasagne sheets
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 700g (about 6) courgettes, coarsely grated
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 250g tub ricotta
- 50g cheddar, grated
- 350g jar tomato sauce for pasta

## Method

1. Heat oven to 220ºC (fan 200ºC).
1. Cook the lasagne sheets for about 5 minutes until softened, but not cooked through. Rinse in cold water and then drizzle with a little oil to stop them sticking together.
1. Meanwhile, fry the onion in a large frying pan. After three minutes, add the courgette and garlic and continue to fry until the courgette has softened and turned bright green.
1. Stir in 2/3rds of both the ricotta and cheddar, then season to taste.
1. Heat the tomato sauce in the oven for 2 minutes on full power until hot.
1. In a large baking dish, layer up the lasagne (note: we used 12 sheets of pasta and did courgette/pasta/tomato/pasta/courgette/pasta/cheese topping).
1. Top with blobs of remaining ricotta and cheddar.
1. Bake for 10 minutes until pasta is tender and the cheese golden.
