## Ingredients

- 350g pork tenderloin, cut into strips
- 1 level teaspoon mustard powder
- 1 heaped teaspoon grain mustard
- 1 heaped teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 110g small open-cap mushrooms, sliced
- 200 ml crème fraîche
- 1 dessertspoon groundnut oil
- 10 g butter
- 1 small onion, peeled, thinly sliced
- 75 ml dry white wine
- salt and freshly milled black pepper

## Method

1. In a small bowl, mix together the three mustards with the crème fraîche and, when you're ready to cook the pork, take the frying pan and heat the oil and butter together over a medium heat.
1. Add the onion slices and fry them gently for about 2-3 minutes until they're soft. Remove the onions to a plate, turn the heat up under the pan to its highest setting and, when it's smoking hot, add the strips of pork and fry them quickly, keeping them on the move all the time so they cook evenly, without burning. Then add the mushrooms and toss these around to cook very briefly until their juices start to run. After that, return the onion slices to the pan and stir them in.
1. Season well with salt and pepper, then add the wine and let it bubble and reduce slightly before adding the crème fraîche. Now stir the whole lot together and let the sauce bubble and reduce to half its original volume. Serve immediately spooned over rice.
