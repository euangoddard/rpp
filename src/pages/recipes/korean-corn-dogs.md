## Ingredients

- 4 jumbo hot dogs sausages
- 120g panko breadcrumbs
- vegetable oil, for frying

### For the dough

- 250g plain flour
- 100ml milk
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt

### For the gochujang ketchup

- 300g tomato ketchup
- 100g gochujang
- 1 tbsp golden syrup
- 1 tsp crushed garlic
- 1/2 tbsp soy sauce

## Method

1. Spear each sausage with a skewer lengthways, leaving 10cm of the skewer sticking out of the end.
1. Thoroughly mix the dough ingredients together in a large bowl until smooth, then leave to rise at room temperature for 1 hour. The consistency should be somewhere between a batter and a dough, leaning closer to the dough side.
1. Once the dough has risen, evenly coat each sausage in the dough, using your hands to shape the dough around the sausage. Roll the dough-coated sausages in the panko breadcrumbs until evenly coated.
1. Heat the oil in a deep pan to 175Â°C. Fry the corn dogs in batches for 5-6 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through. Drain on kitchen paper.

### To make the gochujang ketchup

1. Mix the ketchup, gochujang, and golden syrup together in a bowl until well combined.
1. Add the garlic and soy sauce, then mix to incorporate. Serve with the corn dogs.
