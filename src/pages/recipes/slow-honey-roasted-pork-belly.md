## Ingredients

- 1kg piece of pork belly, boned but with the rind left on
- 5 large onions, halved and sliced
- 1 tsp white peppercorns, crushed
- sea salt
- 2-3 tbsp honey

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 160ºC.
1. Using kitchen paper, wipe the pork bely rind to ensure it is dry. Take a very sharp knife and score through the rind, making cuts 1cm apart (or ask your butcher to do this for you!).
1. Put the onions in a roasting tin and put the belly, rind side up, on top. Trickle with a little oil and press on the white peppercorns and a little sea salt. Roast for 1 hour.
1. Remove from the oven and baste with any fat and juices. Add 1-2 tbsp water to stop the onions from drying out. Cook for 1½ hours more, basting every 20 minutes.
1. Take the meat out of the oven and increase the temperature to 200ºC. Pour the honey over the belly and roast for 30-40 minutes, basting a few more times.
1. Remove the pork from the tin and rest for 10-15 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, put the roasting tin over a moderate heat and pour 2-3 tbsp water on to the onions. Stir well to incorporate any juices and crusty bits left in the tin.
1. To serve, cut the pork belly into 4 portions. Spoon the onions on to plates and top with the pork pieces. Drizzle with any remaining cooking liquor.
