## Ingredients

- 450g/1lb small cherry, plum or vine-ripened tomatoes
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 3 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 sprig of rosemary, leaves finely chopped
- 4 sage leaves, shredded thinly
- a good pinch of dried chilli flakes, or 1 red finger chilli, seeded and finely chopped
- 55g/2oz salted capers, excess salt rubbed off
- 110g/4oz small black olives, pitted
- 2 x 50g/2oz cans of anchovy fillets in oil, drained and chopped
- 2 tbsp chopped oregano
- 450g/1lb dried bucatini or spaghetti
- 1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley

## Method

1. Bring 3.4 litre/6 pint water and 2 tbsp salt to the boil for the pasta.
1. For the sauce, squeeze the tomatoes into the sink to get rid of most of the juice, then cut each one in half.
1. Heat the oil in a pan with the garlic, rosemary and sage and cook gently for about 1 minute without browning.
1. Add the chilli, tomatoes, capers, olives, anchovies, oregano and some black pepper and leave to simmer gently for 10 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, add the pasta to the pan of boiling water and cook for about 7 minutes or until al dente.
1. Drain and tip it into a large warmed serving bowl. Pour over the sauce, add the chopped parsley and toss together well. Serve straight away, with plenty of red wine.
