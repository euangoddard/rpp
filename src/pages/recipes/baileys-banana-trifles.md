## Ingredients

- 300g pot extra-thick double cream
- 7 tbsp Baileys

- 3 bananas, sliced
- 500g pot vanilla custard
- 6 tbsp toffee sauce
- 25g chocolate, grated

## Method

1. Mix the cream with 1 tbsp Baileys, and set aside. Divide the brownie pieces between 6 glasses, then drizzle each with 1 tbsp Baileys. Top with the sliced bananas, custard and Baileys cream, dividing equally, then drizzle with toffee sauce and finish with grated chocolate. Can be made a few hours ahead.
