## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp sunflower oil
- 1 large onion , chopped
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 400g sweet potatoes , cut into medium chunks
- Â½ tsp crushed chilli flakes
- 400g can chopped tomatoes
- 140g salted, roasted peanuts
- 250g chard , leaves and stems, washed and roughly chopped

## Method

1. Heat a large saucepan with a lid over a medium heat and add the oil. Add the onion and fry until light golden. Stir in the cumin seeds until fragrant, about 1 min, then add the sweet potato, chilli flakes, tomatoes and 750ml water. Stir, cover and bring to the boil, then uncover and simmer for 15 mins.
1. Meanwhile, whizz the peanuts in a food processor until finely ground, but stop before you end up with peanut butter. Add them to the stew, stir and taste for seasoning - you may want to add a pinch more salt. Simmer for a further 15 mins, stirring frequently.
1. Finally, stir in the chard. Return to the boil and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 mins or until the chard is cooked. Serve piping hot with plenty of freshly ground black pepper.
