## Ingredients

- **Frozen petits pois** – 750g
- **Leeks** – 400g (trimmed weight), cut into approx. 3cm slices
- **Garlic** – 2 fat cloves, peeled and minced
- **Dry white vermouth** – 4 x 15ml tablespoons (60ml)
- **Regular olive oil** – 2 x 15ml tablespoons, plus more for drizzling
- **Sea salt flakes** – 2 teaspoons, plus more for sprinkling
- **Dill** – small bunch (approx. 25g), torn into pieces
- **Chicken thighs** – 8, skin-on and bone-in

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C Fan and clatter the frozen peas into a large roasting tin, followed by the leeks, garlic, vermouth, 2 tablespoons of oil, 2 teaspoons of sea salt flakes, and most of the dill. Turn everything together in the pan – breaking up any large clumps of the frozen peas – until well mixed. I advise you to wear CSI gloves for this, just to stop you getting frostbite, though you still will feel the cold.

2. Arrange the chicken thighs, skin-side up, on top, then drizzle them with a little olive oil and give them a good sprinkling of sea salt flakes, before roasting in the oven for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven, give the peas a small stir or tamp down, so that the few that are sitting on the surface and drying out a little are submerged in the liquid. Don’t do the same to the leeks, however, as the bits that are peeking out will become desirably caramelised in the heat. Put back in the oven for a further 30 minutes, by which time the peas and leeks will be soft, and the chicken tender and cooked through, its skin golden and crisp.

3. Tear off the remaining dill fronds, and scatter over the top on serving, perhaps with some simply steamed new potatoes to soak up the pea and chicken juices.
